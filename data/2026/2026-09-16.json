And he was full of wisdom, understanding, and skill for making any work in bronze. He came to King Solomon and did all his work.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-15\" id=\"en-ESV-8950\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>He cast two pillars of bronze. Eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits measured its circumference. It was hollow, and its thickness was four fingers. The second pillar was the same.</span> <span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-16\" id=\"en-ESV-8951\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars. The height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.</span> <span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-17\" id=\"en-ESV-8952\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>There were lattices of checker work with wreaths of chain work for the capitals on the tops of the pillars, a lattice for the one capital and a lattice for the other capital.</span> <span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-18\" id=\"en-ESV-8953\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Likewise he made pomegranates in two rows around the one latticework to cover the capital that was on the top of the pillar, and he did the same with the other capital.</span> <span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-19\" id=\"en-ESV-8954\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Now the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars in the vestibule were of lily-work, four cubits.</span> <span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-20\" id=\"en-ESV-8955\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>The capitals were on the two pillars and also above the rounded projection which was beside the latticework. There were two hundred pomegranates in two rows all around, and so with the other capital.</span> <span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-21\" id=\"en-ESV-8956\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>He set up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple.

The sea was set on them, and all their rear parts were inward.</span> <span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-26\" id=\"en-ESV-8961\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>Its thickness was a handbreadth, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held two thousand baths.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-27\" id=\"en-ESV-8962\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>He also made the ten stands of bronze. Each stand was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.</span> <span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-28\" id=\"en-ESV-8963\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>This was the construction of the stands: they had panels, and the panels were set in the frames,</span> <span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-29\" id=\"en-ESV-8964\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>and on the panels that were set in the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim.

The supports were cast with wreaths at the side of each.</span> <span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-31\" id=\"en-ESV-8966\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>Its opening was within a crown that projected upward one cubit. Its opening was round, as a pedestal is made, a cubit and a half deep. At its opening there were carvings, and its panels were square, not round.</span> <span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-32\" id=\"en-ESV-8967\"><sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>And the four wheels were underneath the panels. The axles of the wheels were of one piece with the stands, and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.</span> <span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-33\" id=\"en-ESV-8968\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>The wheels were made like a chariot wheel; their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast.</span> <span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-34\" id=\"en-ESV-8969\"><sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>There were four supports at the four corners of each stand. The supports were of one piece with the stands.</span> <span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-35\" id=\"en-ESV-8970\"><sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>And on the top of the stand there was a round band half a cubit high; and on the top of the stand its stays and its panels were of one piece with it.</span> <span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-36\" id=\"en-ESV-8971\"><sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>And on the surfaces of its stays and on its panels, he carved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths all around.</span> <span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-37\" id=\"en-ESV-8972\"><sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>After this manner he made the ten stands. All of them were cast alike, of the same measure and the same form.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-38\" id=\"en-ESV-8973\"><sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>And he made ten basins of bronze. Each basin held forty baths, each basin measured four cubits, and there was a basin for each of the ten stands.</span> <span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-39\" id=\"en-ESV-8974\"><sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>And he set the stands, five on the south side of the house, and five on the north side of the house. And he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 1Kgs-7-40\" id=\"en-ESV-8975\"><sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>Hiram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins.
