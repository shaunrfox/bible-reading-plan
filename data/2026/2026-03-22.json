Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!</span> <span class=\"text Rom-6-16\" id=\"en-ESV-28069\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?</span> <span class=\"text Rom-6-17\" id=\"en-ESV-28070\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed,</span> <span class=\"text Rom-6-18\" id=\"en-ESV-28071\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-6-19\" id=\"en-ESV-28072\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations.

It was a cave, and a stone lay against it.</span> <span class=\"text John-11-39\" id=\"en-ESV-26551\"><sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>Jesus said, <span class=\"woj\">“Take away the stone.”</span> Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, “Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead four days.”</span> <span class=\"text John-11-40\" id=\"en-ESV-26552\"><sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>Jesus said to her, <span class=\"woj\">“Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-11-41\" id=\"en-ESV-26553\"><sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>So they took away the stone.
