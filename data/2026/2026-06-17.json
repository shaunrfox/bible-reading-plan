Certainly not!</span> <span class=\"text Gal-2-18\" id=\"en-ESV-29083\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>For if I rebuild what I tore down, I prove myself to be a transgressor.</span> <span class=\"text Gal-2-19\" id=\"en-ESV-29084\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God.</span> <span class=\"text Gal-2-20\" id=\"en-ESV-29085\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</span> <span class=\"text Gal-2-21\" id=\"en-ESV-29086\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose.</span></p>  <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",
