Whether it is love or hate, man does not know; both are before him.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-9-2\" id=\"en-ESV-17478\"><sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>It is the same for all, since the same event happens to the righteous and the wicked, to the good and the evil, to the clean and the unclean, to him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice. As the good one is, so is the sinner, and he who swears is as he who shuns an oath.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-9-3\" id=\"en-ESV-17479\"><sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that the same event happens to all.
