We have one Father—even God.”</span> <span class=\"text John-8-42\" id=\"en-ESV-26412\"><sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>Jesus said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-43\" id=\"en-ESV-26413\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">43 </sup>Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-44\" id=\"en-ESV-26414\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">44 </sup>You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-45\" id=\"en-ESV-26415\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">45 </sup>But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-46\" id=\"en-ESV-26416\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">46 </sup>Which one of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-47\" id=\"en-ESV-26417\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">47 </sup>Whoever is of God hears the words of God. The reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God.”</span></span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-8-48\" id=\"en-ESV-26418\">Before Abraham Was, I Am</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-8-48\"><sup class=\"versenum\">48 </sup>The Jews answered him, “Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?”</span> <span class=\"text John-8-49\" id=\"en-ESV-26419\"><sup class=\"versenum\">49 </sup>Jesus answered, <span class=\"woj\">“I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-50\" id=\"en-ESV-26420\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">50 </sup>Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it, and he is the judge.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-51\" id=\"en-ESV-26421\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">51 </sup>Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-52\" id=\"en-ESV-26422\"><sup class=\"versenum\">52 </sup>The Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon!

And the prophets died! Who do you make yourself out to be?”</span> <span class=\"text John-8-54\" id=\"en-ESV-26424\"><sup class=\"versenum\">54 </sup>Jesus answered, <span class=\"woj\">“If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, ‘He is our God.’</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-55\" id=\"en-ESV-26425\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">55 </sup>But you have not known him. I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and I keep his word.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-56\" id=\"en-ESV-26426\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">56 </sup>Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was glad.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-57\" id=\"en-ESV-26427\"><sup class=\"versenum\">57 </sup>So the Jews said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?”</span> <span class=\"text John-8-58\" id=\"en-ESV-26428\"><sup class=\"versenum\">58 </sup>Jesus said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-59\" id=\"en-ESV-26429\"><sup class=\"versenum\">59 </sup>So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.</span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",
