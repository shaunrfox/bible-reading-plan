So he lived in a cave with his two daughters.</span> <span class=\"text Gen-19-31\" id=\"en-ESV-489\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>And the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.</span> <span class=\"text Gen-19-32\" id=\"en-ESV-490\"><sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.”</span> <span class=\"text Gen-19-33\" id=\"en-ESV-491\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>So they made their father drink wine that night.

        "biography": "<p>When Jesus&rsquo;s disciple Simon confessed, &ldquo;You are the Christ,&rdquo; Jesus responded, &ldquo;You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church.&rdquo; This fisherman and his brother Andrew were the first disciples called by Jesus. Peter figures prominently in the Gospels, often stumbling, impetuous, intense, and uncouth.</p>\n\n<p>It was Peter who attempted to walk on the sea, and began to sink; it was Peter who impulsively wished to build three tabernacles on the mountain of the Transfiguration; it was Peter who, just before the crucifixion, three times denied knowing his Lord.</p>\n\n<p>But it was also Peter who, after Pentecost, risked his life to do the Lord&rsquo;s work, speaking boldly of his belief in Jesus. It was also Peter, the Rock, whose strength and courage helped the young Church in its questioning about the mission beyond the Jewish community. Opposed at first to the baptism of Gentiles, he had the humility to admit a change of heart, and to baptize the Roman centurion Cornelius and his household. Even after this, Peter had a continuing struggle with his conservatism, for Paul, writing to the Galatians, rebukes him for giving way to the demands of Jewish Christians to dissociate himself from table-fellowship with Gentiles.</p>\n\n<p>Though the New Testament makes no mention of it, the tradition connecting Peter with Rome is early and virtually certain. According to a legend based on that tradition, Peter fled from Rome during the persecution under Nero. On the Appian Way, he met Christ, and asked him, &ldquo;Domine, quo vadis?&rdquo; (&ldquo;Lord, where are you going?&rdquo;). Jesus answered, &ldquo;I am coming to be crucified again.&rdquo; Peter thereupon retraced his steps, and was shortly thereafter crucified, head downwards. &ldquo;I am not worthy to be crucified as my Lord was,&rdquo; he is supposed to have said.</p>\n\n<p>As we watch Peter struggle with himself, often stumble, love his Lord and deny him, speak rashly and act impetuously, his life reminds us that our Lord did not come to save the godly and strong but to save the weak and the sinful.

        "biography": "<p>When Jesus&rsquo;s disciple Simon confessed, &ldquo;You are the Christ,&rdquo; Jesus responded, &ldquo;You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church.&rdquo; This fisherman and his brother Andrew were the first disciples called by Jesus. Peter figures prominently in the Gospels, often stumbling, impetuous, intense, and uncouth.</p>\n\n<p>It was Peter who attempted to walk on the sea, and began to sink; it was Peter who impulsively wished to build three tabernacles on the mountain of the Transfiguration; it was Peter who, just before the crucifixion, three times denied knowing his Lord.</p>\n\n<p>But it was also Peter who, after Pentecost, risked his life to do the Lord&rsquo;s work, speaking boldly of his belief in Jesus. It was also Peter, the Rock, whose strength and courage helped the young Church in its questioning about the mission beyond the Jewish community. Opposed at first to the baptism of Gentiles, he had the humility to admit a change of heart, and to baptize the Roman centurion Cornelius and his household. Even after this, Peter had a continuing struggle with his conservatism, for Paul, writing to the Galatians, rebukes him for giving way to the demands of Jewish Christians to dissociate himself from table-fellowship with Gentiles.</p>\n\n<p>Though the New Testament makes no mention of it, the tradition connecting Peter with Rome is early and virtually certain. According to a legend based on that tradition, Peter fled from Rome during the persecution under Nero. On the Appian Way, he met Christ, and asked him, &ldquo;Domine, quo vadis?&rdquo; (&ldquo;Lord, where are you going?&rdquo;). Jesus answered, &ldquo;I am coming to be crucified again.&rdquo; Peter thereupon retraced his steps, and was shortly thereafter crucified, head downwards. &ldquo;I am not worthy to be crucified as my Lord was,&rdquo; he is supposed to have said.</p>\n\n<p>As we watch Peter struggle with himself, often stumble, love his Lord and deny him, speak rashly and act impetuously, his life reminds us that our Lord did not come to save the godly and strong but to save the weak and the sinful. Simon, an ordinary human being, was&nbsp;transformed by the Holy Spirit into the &ldquo;Rock,&rdquo; and became the leader of the Church.</p>\n\n<p>Since 1908, the eight days between the feast of the Confession of Saint Peter and the feast of the Conversion of Saint Paul have been observed ecumenically as the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity.</p>",
