See to it yourself.”</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-5\" id=\"en-ESV-24131\"><sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself.</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-6\" id=\"en-ESV-24132\"><sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, “It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money.”</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-7\" id=\"en-ESV-24133\"><sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>So they took counsel and bought with them the potter's field as a burial place for strangers.</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-8\" id=\"en-ESV-24134\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-9\" id=\"en-ESV-24135\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel,</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-10\" id=\"en-ESV-24136\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me.”</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Matt-27-11\" id=\"en-ESV-24137\">Jesus Before Pilate</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Matt-27-11\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus said, <span class=\"woj\">“You have said so.”</span></span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-12\" id=\"en-ESV-24138\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer.</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-13\" id=\"en-ESV-24139\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Then Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?”</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-14\" id=\"en-ESV-24140\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Matt-27-15\" id=\"en-ESV-24141\">The Crowd Chooses Barabbas</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Matt-27-15\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted.</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-16\" id=\"en-ESV-24142\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-17\" id=\"en-ESV-24143\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?”</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-18\" id=\"en-ESV-24144\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up.</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-19\" id=\"en-ESV-24145\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today in a dream.”</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-20\" id=\"en-ESV-24146\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-21\" id=\"en-ESV-24147\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>The governor again said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas.”</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-22\" id=\"en-ESV-24148\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Pilate said to them, “Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” They all said, “Let him be crucified!”</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-23\" id=\"en-ESV-24149\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>And he said, “Why? What evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Let him be crucified!”</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Matt-27-24\" id=\"en-ESV-24150\">Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Matt-27-24\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves.”</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-25\" id=\"en-ESV-24151\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>And all the people answered, “His blood be on us and on our children!”</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-26\" id=\"en-ESV-24152\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>Then he released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.</span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",
