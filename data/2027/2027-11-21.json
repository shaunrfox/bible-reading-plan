And he sat down and taught the people from the boat.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-5-4\" id=\"en-ESV-25103\"><sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>And when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, <span class=\"woj\">“Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.”</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-5-5\" id=\"en-ESV-25104\"><sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>And Simon answered, “Master, we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.”</span> <span class=\"text Luke-5-6\" id=\"en-ESV-25105\"><sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>And when they had done this, they enclosed a large number of fish, and their nets were breaking.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-5-7\" id=\"en-ESV-25106\"><sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-5-8\" id=\"en-ESV-25107\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.”</span> <span class=\"text Luke-5-9\" id=\"en-ESV-25108\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken,</span> <span class=\"text Luke-5-10\" id=\"en-ESV-25109\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.
