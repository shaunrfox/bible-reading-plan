Do as you wish. Behold, I am with you heart and soul.”</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-14-8\" id=\"en-ESV-7517\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Then Jonathan said, “Behold, we will cross over to the men, and we will show ourselves to them.</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-14-9\" id=\"en-ESV-7518\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>If they say to us, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stand still in our place, and we will not go up to them.</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-14-10\" id=\"en-ESV-7519\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up, for the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> has given them into our hand.

And the Philistines said, “Look, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.”</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-14-12\" id=\"en-ESV-7521\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>And the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor-bearer and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you a thing.” And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Come up after me, for the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> has given them into the hand of Israel.”</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-14-13\" id=\"en-ESV-7522\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer after him.

See how my eyes have become bright because I tasted a little of this honey.</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-14-30\" id=\"en-ESV-7539\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies that they found. For now the defeat among the Philistines has not been great.”</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 1Sam-14-31\" id=\"en-ESV-7540\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>They struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint.</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-14-32\" id=\"en-ESV-7541\"><sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>The people pounced on the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slaughtered them on the ground. And the people ate them with the blood.</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-14-33\" id=\"en-ESV-7542\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>Then they told Saul, “Behold, the people are sinning against the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> by eating with the blood.” And he said, “You have dealt treacherously; roll a great stone to me here.”</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-14-34\" id=\"en-ESV-7543\"><sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>And Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them, ‘Let every man bring his ox or his sheep and slaughter them here and eat, and do not sin against the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> by eating with the blood.’” So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night and they slaughtered them there.</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-14-35\" id=\"en-ESV-7544\"><sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>And Saul built an altar to the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>; it was the first altar that he built to the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 1Sam-14-36\" id=\"en-ESV-7545\"><sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>Then Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until the morning light; let us not leave a man of them.” And they said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” But the priest said, “Let us draw near to God here.”</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-14-37\" id=\"en-ESV-7546\"><sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>And Saul inquired of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into the hand of Israel?” But he did not answer him that day.</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-14-38\" id=\"en-ESV-7547\"><sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>And Saul said, “Come here, all you leaders of the people, and know and see how this sin has arisen today.</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-14-39\" id=\"en-ESV-7548\"><sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>For as the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> lives who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.” But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-14-40\" id=\"en-ESV-7549\"><sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>Then he said to all Israel, “You shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.” And the people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.”</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-14-41\" id=\"en-ESV-7550\"><sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>Therefore Saul said, “O <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> God of Israel, why have you not answered your servant this day? If this guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son, O <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, God of Israel, give Urim. But if this guilt is in your people Israel, give Thummim.” And Jonathan and Saul were taken, but the people escaped.</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-14-42\" id=\"en-ESV-7551\"><sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>Then Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan.” And Jonathan was taken.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 1Sam-14-43\" id=\"en-ESV-7552\"><sup class=\"versenum\">43 </sup>Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” And Jonathan told him, “I tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am; I will die.”</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-14-44\" id=\"en-ESV-7553\"><sup class=\"versenum\">44 </sup>And Saul said, “God do so to me and more also; you shall surely die, Jonathan.”</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-14-45\" id=\"en-ESV-7554\"><sup class=\"versenum\">45 </sup>Then the people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.” So the people ransomed Jonathan, so that he did not die.</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-14-46\" id=\"en-ESV-7555\"><sup class=\"versenum\">46 </sup>Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text 1Sam-14-47\" id=\"en-ESV-7556\">Saul Fights Israel's Enemies</span></h3><p><span class=\"text 1Sam-14-47\"><sup class=\"versenum\">47 </sup>When Saul had taken the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, against the Ammonites, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines.
