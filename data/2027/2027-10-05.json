It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard,</span> <span class=\"text Heb-2-4\" id=\"en-ESV-29965\"><sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Heb-2-5\" id=\"en-ESV-29966\">The Founder of Salvation</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Heb-2-5\"><sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking.</span> <span class=\"text Heb-2-6\" id=\"en-ESV-29967\"><sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>It has been testified somewhere,</span></p><div class=\"poetry top-1\"><p class=\"line\"><span class=\"text Heb-2-6\">“What is man, that you are mindful of him,</span><br/><span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Heb-2-6\">or the son of man, that you care for him?</span></span><br/><span class=\"text Heb-2-7\" id=\"en-ESV-29968\"><sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>You made him for a little while lower than the angels;</span><br/><span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Heb-2-7\">you have crowned him with glory and honor,</span></span><br/><span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"text Heb-2-8\" id=\"en-ESV-29969\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span>putting everything in subjection under his feet.”</span></span></p></div><p class=\"first-line-none top-1\"><span class=\"text Heb-2-8\">Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control.
