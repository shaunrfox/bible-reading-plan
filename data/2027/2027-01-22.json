And the word of the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> was rare in those days; there was no frequent vision.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 1Sam-3-2\" id=\"en-ESV-7279\"><sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>At that time Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see, was lying down in his own place.</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-3-3\" id=\"en-ESV-7280\"><sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, where the ark of God was.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 1Sam-3-4\" id=\"en-ESV-7281\"><sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Then the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> called Samuel, and he said, “Here I am!”</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-3-5\" id=\"en-ESV-7282\"><sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>and ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call; lie down again.” So he went and lay down.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 1Sam-3-6\" id=\"en-ESV-7283\"><sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>And the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> called again, “Samuel!” and Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call, my son; lie down again.”</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-3-7\" id=\"en-ESV-7284\"><sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Now Samuel did not yet know the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, and the word of the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> had not yet been revealed to him.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 1Sam-3-8\" id=\"en-ESV-7285\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>And the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” Then Eli perceived that the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> was calling the boy.</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-3-9\" id=\"en-ESV-7286\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down, and if he calls you, you shall say, ‘Speak, <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, for your servant hears.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 1Sam-3-10\" id=\"en-ESV-7287\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>And the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> came and stood, calling as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” And Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant hears.”</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-3-11\" id=\"en-ESV-7288\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Then the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> said to Samuel, “Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel at which the two ears of everyone who hears it will tingle.</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-3-12\" id=\"en-ESV-7289\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>On that day I will fulfill against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-3-13\" id=\"en-ESV-7290\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>And I declare to him that I am about to punish his house forever, for the iniquity that he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God, and he did not restrain them.</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-3-14\" id=\"en-ESV-7291\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever.”</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 1Sam-3-15\" id=\"en-ESV-7292\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Samuel lay until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>. And Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-3-16\" id=\"en-ESV-7293\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>But Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” And he said, “Here I am.”</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-3-17\" id=\"en-ESV-7294\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>And Eli said, “What was it that he told you? Do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and more also if you hide anything from me of all that he told you.”</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-3-18\" id=\"en-ESV-7295\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And he said, “It is the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>. Let him do what seems good to him.”</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 1Sam-3-19\" id=\"en-ESV-7296\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>And Samuel grew, and the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-3-20\" id=\"en-ESV-7297\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>.</span> </p>\n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div> \n"
