And although there were so many, the net was not torn.</span> <span class=\"text John-21-12\" id=\"en-ESV-26899\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Jesus said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“Come and have breakfast.”</span> Now none of the disciples dared ask him, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Lord.</span> <span class=\"text John-21-13\" id=\"en-ESV-26900\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and so with the fish.</span> <span class=\"text John-21-14\" id=\"en-ESV-26901\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-21-15\" id=\"en-ESV-26902\">Jesus and Peter</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-21-15\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <span class=\"woj\">“Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?”</span> He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him, <span class=\"woj\">“Feed my lambs.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-21-16\" id=\"en-ESV-26903\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>He said to him a second time, <span class=\"woj\">“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”</span> He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him, <span class=\"woj\">“Tend my sheep.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-21-17\" id=\"en-ESV-26904\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>He said to him the third time, <span class=\"woj\">“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”</span> Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, <span class=\"woj\">“Do you love me?”</span> and he said to him, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, <span class=\"woj\">“Feed my sheep.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-21-18\" id=\"en-ESV-26905\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-21-19\" id=\"en-ESV-26906\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>(This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, <span class=\"woj\">“Follow me.”</span></span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-21-20\" id=\"en-ESV-26907\">Jesus and the Beloved Apostle</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-21-20\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who also had leaned back against him during the supper and had said, “Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?”</span> <span class=\"text John-21-21\" id=\"en-ESV-26908\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, “Lord, what about this man?”</span> <span class=\"text John-21-22\" id=\"en-ESV-26909\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Jesus said to him, <span class=\"woj\">“If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-21-23\" id=\"en-ESV-26910\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>So the saying spread abroad among the brothers that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, <span class=\"woj\">“If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?”</span></span></p> <p><span class=\"text John-21-24\" id=\"en-ESV-26911\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text John-21-25\" id=\"en-ESV-26912\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>Now there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.</span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div> \n"
