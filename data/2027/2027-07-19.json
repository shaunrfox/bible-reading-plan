For we were so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-1-9\" id=\"en-ESV-28793\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. But that was to make us rely not on ourselves but on God who raises the dead.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-1-10\" id=\"en-ESV-28794\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>He delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-1-11\" id=\"en-ESV-28795\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>You also must help us by prayer, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text 2Cor-1-12\" id=\"en-ESV-28796\">Paul's Change of Plans</span></h3><p><span class=\"text 2Cor-1-12\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>For our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience, that we behaved in the world with simplicity and godly sincerity, not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God, and supremely so toward you.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-1-13\" id=\"en-ESV-28797\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>For we are not writing to you anything other than what you read and understand and I hope you will fully understand—</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-1-14\" id=\"en-ESV-28798\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>just as you did partially understand us—that on the day of our Lord Jesus you will boast of us as we will boast of you.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 2Cor-1-15\" id=\"en-ESV-28799\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Because I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a second experience of grace.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-1-16\" id=\"en-ESV-28800\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to come back to you from Macedonia and have you send me on my way to Judea.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-1-17\" id=\"en-ESV-28801\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Was I vacillating when I wanted to do this? Do I make my plans according to the flesh, ready to say “Yes, yes” and “No, no” at the same time?</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-1-18\" id=\"en-ESV-28802\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>As surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-1-19\" id=\"en-ESV-28803\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we proclaimed among you, Silvanus and Timothy and I, was not Yes and No, but in him it is always Yes.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-1-20\" id=\"en-ESV-28804\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-1-21\" id=\"en-ESV-28805\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us,</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-1-22\" id=\"en-ESV-28806\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 2Cor-1-23\" id=\"en-ESV-28807\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>But I call God to witness against me—it was to spare you that I refrained from coming again to Corinth.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-1-24\" id=\"en-ESV-28808\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, for you stand firm in your faith.</span></p> <p class=\"chapter-1\"><span class=\"text 2Cor-2-1\" id=\"en-ESV-28809\"><span class=\"chapternum\">2 </span>For I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-2-2\" id=\"en-ESV-28810\"><sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained?</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-2-3\" id=\"en-ESV-28811\"><sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice, for I felt sure of all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-2-4\" id=\"en-ESV-28812\"><sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text 2Cor-2-5\" id=\"en-ESV-28813\">Forgive the Sinner</span></h3><p><span class=\"text 2Cor-2-5\"><sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Now if anyone has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure—not to put it too severely—to all of you.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-2-6\" id=\"en-ESV-28814\"><sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>For such a one, this punishment by the majority is enough,</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-2-7\" id=\"en-ESV-28815\"><sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-2-8\" id=\"en-ESV-28816\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-2-9\" id=\"en-ESV-28817\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-2-10\" id=\"en-ESV-28818\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. Indeed, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ,</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-2-11\" id=\"en-ESV-28819\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs.</span></p>  <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",
