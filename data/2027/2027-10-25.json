You need milk, not solid food,</span> <span class=\"text Heb-5-13\" id=\"en-ESV-30027\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>for everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is a child.</span> <span class=\"text Heb-5-14\" id=\"en-ESV-30028\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil.</span></p> <p class=\"chapter-1\"><span class=\"text Heb-6-1\" id=\"en-ESV-30029\"><span class=\"chapternum\">6 </span>Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,</span> <span class=\"text Heb-6-2\" id=\"en-ESV-30030\"><sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>and of instruction about washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</span> <span class=\"text Heb-6-3\" id=\"en-ESV-30031\"><sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>And this we will do if God permits.</span> <span class=\"text Heb-6-4\" id=\"en-ESV-30032\"><sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>For it is impossible, in the case of those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit,</span> <span class=\"text Heb-6-5\" id=\"en-ESV-30033\"><sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come,</span> <span class=\"text Heb-6-6\" id=\"en-ESV-30034\"><sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>and then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance, since they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt.</span> <span class=\"text Heb-6-7\" id=\"en-ESV-30035\"><sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>For land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it, and produces a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God.</span> <span class=\"text Heb-6-8\" id=\"en-ESV-30036\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed, and its end is to be burned.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Heb-6-9\" id=\"en-ESV-30037\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Though we speak in this way, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things—things that belong to salvation.</span> <span class=\"text Heb-6-10\" id=\"en-ESV-30038\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>For God is not unjust so as to overlook your work and the love that you have shown for his name in serving the saints, as you still do.</span> <span class=\"text Heb-6-11\" id=\"en-ESV-30039\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance of hope until the end,</span> <span class=\"text Heb-6-12\" id=\"en-ESV-30040\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</span></p>  <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div> \n"
