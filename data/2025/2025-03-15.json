<strong> He divided the sea and let them go through;</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> he made the waters to stand in a heap.</strong></p><p

fire.</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>16</sup> <strong> He split the hard rocks in the wilderness</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> and gave them drink in abundance, as out of the great deep.</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>17</sup>  He brought waters out of the stony rock, <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> so that it gushed out like the rivers.</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>18</sup> <strong> Yet for all this they sinned more against him,</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> and provoked the Most High in the wilderness.</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>19</sup>  They tested God in their hearts <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> and demanded food for their craving.</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>20</sup> <strong> They spoke against God, saying,</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>21</sup>  Indeed, he smote the stony rock, so that water gushed out, and the streams overflowed; <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> but can he give bread also, or provide meat for his

<strong> He rained meat upon them as thick as dust</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> and feathered fowl like the sand of the sea.</strong></p><p

class='indent'><strong> they did not deny themselves their cravings,</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>31</sup>  But while the food was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath

class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>34</sup> <strong> When he slew them, they sought him,</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> and returned, and inquired after God.</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>35</sup>  And they remembered that God was their rock, <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> and the Most High God was their redeemer.</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>36</sup> <strong> Nevertheless, they flattered him with their mouth</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p

class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> neither did they continue steadfast in his covenant.</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>38</sup> <strong> But he was so merciful that he forgave their iniquities</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> and did not destroy them.</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>39</sup>  Indeed, many times he turned his wrath away <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> and would not permit his displeasure to arise.</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>40</sup> <strong> For he considered that they were but flesh,</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> that they were even as the wind that passes away and comes not again.</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>41</sup>  Many times they provoked him in the wilderness <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> and grieved him in the desert.</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>42</sup> <strong> They turned back, and tested God,</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> and provoked the Holy One of Israel.</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>43</sup>  They remembered not his power, <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> nor the day when he delivered them from the hand of the enemy,</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>44</sup> <strong> How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> and his wonders in the field of Zoan.</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>45</sup>  He turned their waters into blood, <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> so that they might not drink of the rivers.</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>46</sup> <strong> He sent flies among them, which devoured them up,</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> and frogs to destroy them.</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>47</sup>  He gave their fruit to the grasshopper <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> and their labor to the locust.</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>48</sup> <strong> He destroyed their vines with hailstones</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> and their sycamore trees with the frost.</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>49</sup>  He smote their cattle also with hailstones <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> and their flocks with hot thunderbolts.</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>50</sup> <strong> He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure, and trouble,</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> sending these destroying angels among them.</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>51</sup>  He made a way for his indignation, and did not spare their soul from death, <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> but gave their life over to the pestilence,</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>52</sup> <strong> And smote all the firstborn in Egypt,</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> the firstfruits of their strength in the dwellings of Ham.</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>53</sup>  But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> and carried them in the wilderness like a flock.</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>54</sup> <strong> He brought them out safely, and they were not afraid;</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> he overwhelmed their enemies with the sea,</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>55</sup>  And brought them within the borders of his holy land, <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> to his mountain which he obtained with his right hand.</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>56</sup> <strong> He cast out the nations before them,</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> and caused their land to be divided among them for an inheritance, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>57</sup>  But they tested and displeased the Most High God, <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> and did not keep his testimonies,</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>58</sup> <strong> But turned their backs and fell away like their forefathers,</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> twisting aside like a broken bow.</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>59</sup>  For they grieved him with their hill altars <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> and provoked him to displeasure with their images.</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>60</sup> <strong> When God heard this, he was full of wrath</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> and utterly rejected Israel,</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>61</sup>  So that he forsook the tabernacle in Shiloh, <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> even the tent that he had pitched among them.</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>62</sup> <strong> He delivered the ark into captivity,</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> and his glory into the enemy’s hand.</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>63</sup>  He gave his people over to the sword <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> and was angry with his inheritance.</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>64</sup> <strong> Fire consumed their young men,</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> and their maidens had no marriage songs.</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>65</sup>  Their priests were slain with the sword, <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> and their widows made no lamentation.</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>66</sup> <strong> Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> and like a warrior recovered from wine.</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>67</sup>  He drove his enemies backward <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> and put them to a perpetual shame.</p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>68</sup> <strong> He rejected the tabernacle of Joseph</strong> <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'><strong> and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,</strong></p><p class='hanging-indent'><sup class='versenum'>69</sup>  But chose the tribe of Judah, <span class='asterisk'>*</span> </p><p class='indent'> even the hill of
