But what we are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-5-12\" id=\"en-ESV-28873\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you cause to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance and not about what is in the heart.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-5-13\" id=\"en-ESV-28874\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-5-14\" id=\"en-ESV-28875\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died;</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-5-15\" id=\"en-ESV-28876\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>and he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 2Cor-5-16\" id=\"en-ESV-28877\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-5-17\" id=\"en-ESV-28878\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-5-18\" id=\"en-ESV-28879\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation;</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-5-19\" id=\"en-ESV-28880\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.</span> <span class=\"text 2Cor-5-20\" id=\"en-ESV-28881\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us.
