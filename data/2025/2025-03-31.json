Treat me as one of your hired servants.”’</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-15-20\" id=\"en-ESV-25600\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him.</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-15-21\" id=\"en-ESV-25601\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-15-22\" id=\"en-ESV-25602\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-15-23\" id=\"en-ESV-25603\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate.</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-15-24\" id=\"en-ESV-25604\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.’ And they began to celebrate.</span></span></p> <p><span class=\"text Luke-15-25\" id=\"en-ESV-25605\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>“Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-15-26\" id=\"en-ESV-25606\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-15-27\" id=\"en-ESV-25607\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>And he said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.’</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-15-28\" id=\"en-ESV-25608\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him,</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-15-29\" id=\"en-ESV-25609\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>but he answered his father, ‘Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might celebrate with my friends.</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-15-30\" id=\"en-ESV-25610\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!’</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-15-31\" id=\"en-ESV-25611\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>And he said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-15-32\" id=\"en-ESV-25612\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.’”</span></span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div> \n"
