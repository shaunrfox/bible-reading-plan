If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell?</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-12-18\" id=\"en-ESV-28636\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose.</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-12-19\" id=\"en-ESV-28637\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>If all were a single member, where would the body be?</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-12-20\" id=\"en-ESV-28638\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 1Cor-12-21\" id=\"en-ESV-28639\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-12-22\" id=\"en-ESV-28640\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-12-23\" id=\"en-ESV-28641\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-12-24\" id=\"en-ESV-28642\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it,</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-12-25\" id=\"en-ESV-28643\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-12-26\" id=\"en-ESV-28644\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 1Cor-12-27\" id=\"en-ESV-28645\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it.</span> </p>\n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div> \n"
