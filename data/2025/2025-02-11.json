And where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us, saying, ‘Did not the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> bring us up from Egypt?’ But now the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian.”</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-14\" id=\"en-ESV-6669\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>And the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> turned to him and said, “Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian; do not I send you?”</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-15\" id=\"en-ESV-6670\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>And he said to him, “Please, Lord, how can I save Israel?

And Gideon said, “Alas, O Lord <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">God</span>! For now I have seen the angel of the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> face to face.”</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-23\" id=\"en-ESV-6678\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>But the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> said to him, “Peace be to you.

And where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us, saying, ‘Did not the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> bring us up from Egypt?’ But now the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian.”</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-14\" id=\"en-ESV-6669\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>And the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> turned to him and said, “Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian; do not I send you?”</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-15\" id=\"en-ESV-6670\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>And he said to him, “Please, Lord, how can I save Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.”</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-16\" id=\"en-ESV-6671\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>And the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> said to him, “But I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.”</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-17\" id=\"en-ESV-6672\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>And he said to him, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is you who speak with me.</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-18\" id=\"en-ESV-6673\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Please do not depart from here until I come to you and bring out my present and set it before you.” And he said, “I will stay till you return.”</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Judg-6-19\" id=\"en-ESV-6674\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>So Gideon went into his house and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour.

And fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> vanished from his sight.</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-22\" id=\"en-ESV-6677\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>. And Gideon said, “Alas, O Lord <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">God</span>! For now I have seen the angel of the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> face to face.”</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-23\" id=\"en-ESV-6678\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>But the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> said to him, “Peace be to you. Do not fear; you shall not die.”</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-24\" id=\"en-ESV-6679\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Then Gideon built an altar there to the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> and called it, The <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> Is Peace.
