        "biography": "<p>Today&rsquo;s feast is sometimes known as the <strong>Purification of Saint Mary the Virgin</strong>, and also as <strong>Candlemas</strong>. In the Eastern Church it has been called the <strong>Meeting of Christ with Simeon</strong>. Such a variety of names is ample testimony to the wealth of spiritual meaning that generations of Christians have discovered in this small incident.</p>\n\n<p>The title, &ldquo;The Presentation,&rdquo; reminds us of the Jewish law (Exodus 13:2;22:29) that every firstborn son had to be dedicated to God in memory of the Israelites&rsquo; deliverance from Egypt, when the firstborn sons of the Egyptians died and those of Israel were spared.</p>\n\n<p>When Mary placed her small son into the arms of Simeon, it was the meeting of the Old and New Dispensations. The old sacrifices, the burnt offerings and oblations, were done away; a new and perfect offering had come into the temple. God had provided himself a lamb for the burnt-offering (Genesis 22:8), his only Son. The offering was to be made once for all on the cross. At every Eucharist those who are in Christ recall that sinless offering and unite &ldquo;themselves, their souls and bodies&rdquo; with the self-oblation of their Lord and Savior.</p>\n\n<p>It is traditional that candles are blessed on this day, for use throughout the rest of the year, which is why the feast is also sometimes known as &ldquo;Candlemas&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Prayers For Blessing Candles and an Optional Procession, Adapted for Use at Home</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let us pray. O eternal God, who have created all things; on this day you fulfilled the petitions of the just Simeon: we humbly ask you to bless and sanctify these candles for our use. Graciously hear our prayers and be merciful to us, whom you have redeemed by your Son, who is the light of the world, and who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God for ever and ever. Amen.</p>\n\n<p>O God, source of all light, today you revealed to the aged Simeon your light which enlightens the nations. Fill our hearts with the light of faith, that we who bear these candles may walk in the path of goodness, through Jesus Christ the Light of the World.</p>\n\n<p><em>The Nunc Dimittis (Luke 2:29-32) may be sung or said in procession:</em></p>\n\n<p>Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word.<br />\nFor mine eyes have seen thy salvation,<br />\nWhich thou hast prepared before the face of all people;<br />\nTo be a light to lighten the Gentiles and to be the glory of thy people Israel.<br />\nGlory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit<br />\nAs it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be, world without end</p>\n\n<p>O God, you have made this day holy by the presentation of your Son in the Temple, and by the purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary: Mercifully grant that we, who delight in her humble readiness to be the birth-giver of the Only-begotten, may rejoice for ever in our adoption as his sisters and brothers; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Traditions Around the World</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>England: </em>This is considered the last day of the Christmas/Epiphany cycle (40 days after Chritsmas) and the traditional day to take down Christmas decorations.</p>\n\n<p><em>France: </em>Today is Crepe day!&nbsp;Store the first crepe in your&nbsp;wardrobe until harvest to ensure the harvest is plentiful.</p>\n\n<p><em>United States (and similar traditions in Europe): </em>Groundhog Day determines the length of winter. &quot;If&nbsp;Candlemas&nbsp;Day be fair and bright, Winter will have another flight, But if it be dark with clouds and rain, Winter is gone, and will not come again.&quot;&nbsp;</p>",

        "biography": "<p>Today&rsquo;s feast is sometimes known as the <strong>Purification of Saint Mary the Virgin</strong>, and also as <strong>Candlemas</strong>. In the Eastern Church it has been called the <strong>Meeting of Christ with Simeon</strong>. Such a variety of names is ample testimony to the wealth of spiritual meaning that generations of Christians have discovered in this small incident.</p>\n\n<p>The title, &ldquo;The Presentation,&rdquo; reminds us of the Jewish law (Exodus 13:2;22:29) that every firstborn son had to be dedicated to God in memory of the Israelites&rsquo; deliverance from Egypt, when the firstborn sons of the Egyptians died and those of Israel were spared.</p>\n\n<p>When Mary placed her small son into the arms of Simeon, it was the meeting of the Old and New Dispensations. The old sacrifices, the burnt offerings and oblations, were done away; a new and perfect offering had come into the temple. God had provided himself a lamb for the burnt-offering (Genesis 22:8), his only Son. The offering was to be made once for all on the cross. At every Eucharist those who are in Christ recall that sinless offering and unite &ldquo;themselves, their souls and bodies&rdquo; with the self-oblation of their Lord and Savior.</p>\n\n<p>It is traditional that candles are blessed on this day, for use throughout the rest of the year, which is why the feast is also sometimes known as &ldquo;Candlemas&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Prayers For Blessing Candles and an Optional Procession, Adapted for Use at Home</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let us pray. O eternal God, who have created all things; on this day you fulfilled the petitions of the just Simeon: we humbly ask you to bless and sanctify these candles for our use. Graciously hear our prayers and be merciful to us, whom you have redeemed by your Son, who is the light of the world, and who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God for ever and ever. Amen.</p>\n\n<p>O God, source of all light, today you revealed to the aged Simeon your light which enlightens the nations. Fill our hearts with the light of faith, that we who bear these candles may walk in the path of goodness, through Jesus Christ the Light of the World.</p>\n\n<p><em>The Nunc Dimittis (Luke 2:29-32) may be sung or said in procession:</em></p>\n\n<p>Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word.<br />\nFor mine eyes have seen thy salvation,<br />\nWhich thou hast prepared before the face of all people;<br />\nTo be a light to lighten the Gentiles and to be the glory of thy people Israel.<br />\nGlory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit<br />\nAs it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be, world without end</p>\n\n<p>O God, you have made this day holy by the presentation of your Son in the Temple, and by the purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary: Mercifully grant that we, who delight in her humble readiness to be the birth-giver of the Only-begotten, may rejoice for ever in our adoption as his sisters and brothers; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
