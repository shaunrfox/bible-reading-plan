And they told Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses that the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> had commanded Israel.</span> <span class=\"text Neh-8-2\" id=\"en-ESV-12496\"><sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>So Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly, both men and women and all who could understand what they heard, on the first day of the seventh month.</span> <span class=\"text Neh-8-3\" id=\"en-ESV-12497\"><sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>And he read from it facing the square before the Water Gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women and those who could understand. And the ears of all the people were attentive to the Book of the Law.</span> <span class=\"text Neh-8-4\" id=\"en-ESV-12498\"><sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>And Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden platform that they had made for the purpose. And beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right hand, and Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam on his left hand.</span> <span class=\"text Neh-8-5\" id=\"en-ESV-12499\"><sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was above all the people, and as he opened it all the people stood.</span> <span class=\"text Neh-8-6\" id=\"en-ESV-12500\"><sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>And Ezra blessed the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>, the great God, and all the people answered, “Amen, Amen,” lifting up their hands. And they bowed their heads and worshiped the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> with their faces to the ground.</span> <span class=\"text Neh-8-7\" id=\"en-ESV-12501\"><sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, the Levites, helped the people to understand the Law, while the people remained in their places.</span> <span class=\"text Neh-8-8\" id=\"en-ESV-12502\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>They read from the book, from the Law of God, clearly, and they gave the sense, so that the people understood the reading.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Neh-8-9\" id=\"en-ESV-12503\">This Day Is Holy</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Neh-8-9\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, “This day is holy to the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> your God; do not mourn or weep.” For all the people wept as they heard the words of the Law.</span> <span class=\"text Neh-8-10\" id=\"en-ESV-12504\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Then he said to them, “Go your way. Eat the fat and drink sweet wine and send portions to anyone who has nothing ready, for this day is holy to our Lord. And do not be grieved, for the joy of the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> is your strength.”</span> <span class=\"text Neh-8-11\" id=\"en-ESV-12505\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>So the Levites calmed all the people, saying, “Be quiet, for this day is holy; do not be grieved.”</span> <span class=\"text Neh-8-12\" id=\"en-ESV-12506\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>And all the people went their way to eat and drink and to send portions and to make great rejoicing, because they had understood the words that were declared to them.</span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",
