        "biography": "<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Easter Sunday&nbsp;is the greatest of all Sundays, and Eastertide is the most important of all liturgical seasons. Easter is the celebration of the Lord&#39;s resurrection from the dead, culminating in his Ascension to the Father and sending of the Holy Spirit upon the Church. There are 50 days of Easter from the first Sunday to Pentecost. It is characterized, above all, by the joy of glorified life and the victory over death expressed most fully in the great resounding cry of the Christian: Alleluia! All faith flows from faith in the resurrection: &quot;If Christ has not been raised, then empty is our preaching; empty, too, is your faith.&quot; (1 Cor 15:14)</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The octave of Easter comprises the eight days which stretch from the first to the second Sunday. It is a way of prolonging the joy of the initial day. In a sense, every day of the Octave is like a little Sunday.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The word &quot;Easter&quot; comes from Old English, meaning simply the &quot;East.&quot; The sun which rises in the East, bringing light, warmth, and hope, is a symbol for the Christian of the rising Christ, who is the true Light of the world. The Paschal Candle is a central symbol of this divine light, which is Christ. It is kept near the altar throughout Easter Time and lit for all liturgical celebrations.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The Great Vigil of Easter is perhaps the most theologically important service of the Church Year. In it the new fire of God is struck, banishing darkness, and showing forth the victory won on Good Friday; the saving acts of God in history are recounted in the Exsultet and in scripture; new Christians are made through the Sacrament of Holy Baptism; the vows made by all Christians at their baptisms are renewed; and with the end of the Lenten observance, the first Eucharist of the joyful season of Easter is celebrated. The Vigil is not a short service. It marks time in the evening, while the people await the announcement of the Resurrection: &quot;Alleluia. Christ is risen!&quot; He is risen indeed, and the Paschal Candle burns as a sign of the presence of the resurrected Christ.</span></p>\n\n<p><em>For as by a man came death, by a man has come the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive.</em>&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 15:21-22)</p>\n\n<p><em>For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.&nbsp;</em>(Romans 6:5)</p>",
