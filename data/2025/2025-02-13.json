And where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us, saying, ‘Did not the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> bring us up from Egypt?’ But now the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian.”</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-14\" id=\"en-ESV-6669\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>And the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> turned to him and said, “Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian; do not I send you?”</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-15\" id=\"en-ESV-6670\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>And he said to him, “Please, Lord, how can I save Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father's house.”</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-16\" id=\"en-ESV-6671\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>And the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> said to him, “But I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.”</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-17\" id=\"en-ESV-6672\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>And he said to him, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is you who speak with me.</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-18\" id=\"en-ESV-6673\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Please do not depart from here until I come to you and bring out my present and set it before you.” And he said, “I will stay till you return.”</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Judg-6-19\" id=\"en-ESV-6674\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>So Gideon went into his house and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought them to him under the terebinth and presented them.</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-20\" id=\"en-ESV-6675\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>And the angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and put them on this rock, and pour the broth over them.” And he did so.</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-21\" id=\"en-ESV-6676\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Then the angel of the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes. And fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> vanished from his sight.</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-22\" id=\"en-ESV-6677\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>. And Gideon said, “Alas, O Lord <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">God</span>! For now I have seen the angel of the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> face to face.”</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-23\" id=\"en-ESV-6678\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>But the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> said to him, “Peace be to you. Do not fear; you shall not die.”</span> <span class=\"text Judg-6-24\" id=\"en-ESV-6679\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Then Gideon built an altar there to the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> and called it, The <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> Is Peace. To this day it still stands at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites.</span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div> \n"
