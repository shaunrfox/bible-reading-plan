        "biography": "<p>Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of the season of Lent: a time of penitence, fasting, and prayer, in preparation for the great feast of the resurrection.</p>\n\n<p>The season of Lent began in the early days of the Church as a time of preparation for those seeking to be baptized at the Easter Vigil. The forty days refer to our Lord&rsquo;s time of fasting in the wilderness; and since Sundays are never fast days, Ash Wednesday is the beginning of the Lenten Fast.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the Old Testament, ashes are used as a sign of sorrow and repentance, and Christians have traditionally used ashes to indicate sorrow for our own sin, and as a reminder that the wages of sin is death (ROMANS 6:23). Like Adam and Eve, we have disobeyed and rebelled against God, and are under the same judgment, &ldquo;you are dust, and to dust you shall return&rdquo; (GENESIS 3:19).</p>\n\n<p>But as we are marked with ashes in the same manner that we were signed with the Cross in Baptism, we are also reminded of the life we share in Jesus Christ, the second Adam (ROMANS 5:17, 6:4). It is in this sure hope that we begin the journey of these forty days, that by hearing and answering our Savior&rsquo;s call to repent, we may enter fully into the joyful celebration of his resurrection.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>A Litany of Penitence</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Let us humbly confess our sins to Almighty God.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Most holy and merciful Father,</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>we confess to you, and to one another, </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>and to the whole communion of saints </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>in heaven and on earth,</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>that we have sinned, through our own fault </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>in thought, word, and deed;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>by what we have done, and by what we have left undone. </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We have not loved you with our whole heart, and mind,</strong> <strong>and strength.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We have not forgiven others, as we have been forgiven.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We have been deaf to your call to serve, as Christ served us.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We have not been true to the mind of Christ.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We have grieved your Holy Spirit.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For all our unfaithfulness and disobedience; for the pride, vanity, and hypocrisy of our lives;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For our self-pity and impatience, and our envy of those we think more fortunate than ourselves;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For our unrighteous anger, bitterness, and resentment; for all lies, gossip, and slander against our neighbors;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For our sexual impurity, our exploitation of other people, and our failure to give of ourselves in love;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For our self-indulgent appetites and ways, and our intemperate pursuit of worldly goods and comforts;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For our dishonesty in daily life and work, our ingratitude for your gifts, and our failure to heed your call.</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For our blindness to human need and suffering, and our indifference to injustice and cruelty;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For our wastefulness and misuse of your creation, and our lack of concern for those who come after us;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For all false judgments, for prejudice and contempt of others, and for all uncharitable thoughts toward our neighbors;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For our negligence in prayer and worship; for our presumption and abuse of your means of grace;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For seeking the praise of others rather than the approval of God;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For our failure to commend the faith that is in us;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Show favor to your people, O Lord, who turn to you in weeping, fasting, and prayer.

        "biography": "<p>Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of the season of Lent: a time of penitence, fasting, and prayer, in preparation for the great feast of the resurrection.</p>\n\n<p>The season of Lent began in the early days of the Church as a time of preparation for those seeking to be baptized at the Easter Vigil. The forty days refer to our Lord&rsquo;s time of fasting in the wilderness; and since Sundays are never fast days, Ash Wednesday is the beginning of the Lenten Fast.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the Old Testament, ashes are used as a sign of sorrow and repentance, and Christians have traditionally used ashes to indicate sorrow for our own sin, and as a reminder that the wages of sin is death (ROMANS 6:23). Like Adam and Eve, we have disobeyed and rebelled against God, and are under the same judgment, &ldquo;you are dust, and to dust you shall return&rdquo; (GENESIS 3:19).</p>\n\n<p>But as we are marked with ashes in the same manner that we were signed with the Cross in Baptism, we are also reminded of the life we share in Jesus Christ, the second Adam (ROMANS 5:17, 6:4). It is in this sure hope that we begin the journey of these forty days, that by hearing and answering our Savior&rsquo;s call to repent, we may enter fully into the joyful celebration of his resurrection.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>A Litany of Penitence</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Let us humbly confess our sins to Almighty God.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Most holy and merciful Father,</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>we confess to you, and to one another, </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>and to the whole communion of saints </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>in heaven and on earth,</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>that we have sinned, through our own fault </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>in thought, word, and deed;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>by what we have done, and by what we have left undone. </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We have not loved you with our whole heart, and mind,</strong> <strong>and strength.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We have not forgiven others, as we have been forgiven.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We have been deaf to your call to serve, as Christ served us.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We have not been true to the mind of Christ.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We have grieved your Holy Spirit.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For all our unfaithfulness and disobedience; for the pride, vanity, and hypocrisy of our lives;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For our self-pity and impatience, and our envy of those we think more fortunate than ourselves;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For our unrighteous anger, bitterness, and resentment; for all lies, gossip, and slander against our neighbors;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For our sexual impurity, our exploitation of other people, and our failure to give of ourselves in love;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For our self-indulgent appetites and ways, and our intemperate pursuit of worldly goods and comforts;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For our dishonesty in daily life and work, our ingratitude for your gifts, and our failure to heed your call.</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For our blindness to human need and suffering, and our indifference to injustice and cruelty;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For our wastefulness and misuse of your creation, and our lack of concern for those who come after us;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For all false judgments, for prejudice and contempt of others, and for all uncharitable thoughts toward our neighbors;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For our negligence in prayer and worship; for our presumption and abuse of your means of grace;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For seeking the praise of others rather than the approval of God;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For our failure to commend the faith that is in us;</p>\n\n<p>Lord, have mercy upon us:</p>\n\n<p><strong>For we have sinned against you.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Show favor to your people, O Lord, who turn to you in weeping, fasting, and prayer.
