So he lived in a cave with his two daughters.</span> <span class=\"text Gen-19-31\" id=\"en-ESV-489\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>And the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth.</span> <span class=\"text Gen-19-32\" id=\"en-ESV-490\"><sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.”</span> <span class=\"text Gen-19-33\" id=\"en-ESV-491\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>So they made their father drink wine that night.
