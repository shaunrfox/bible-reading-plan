So, if you seek me, let these men go.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-18-9\" id=\"en-ESV-26783\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken: <span class=\"woj\">“Of those whom you gave me I have lost not one.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-18-10\" id=\"en-ESV-26784\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.)</span> <span class=\"text John-18-11\" id=\"en-ESV-26785\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>So Jesus said to Peter, <span class=\"woj\">“Put your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?”</span></span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-18-12\" id=\"en-ESV-26786\">Jesus Faces Annas and Caiaphas</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-18-12\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>So the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him.</span> <span class=\"text John-18-13\" id=\"en-ESV-26787\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>First they led him to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</span> <span class=\"text John-18-14\" id=\"en-ESV-26788\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it would be expedient that one man should die for the people.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-18-15\" id=\"en-ESV-26789\">Peter Denies Jesus</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-18-15\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest,</span> <span class=\"text John-18-16\" id=\"en-ESV-26790\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>but Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the servant girl who kept watch at the door, and brought Peter in.</span> <span class=\"text John-18-17\" id=\"en-ESV-26791\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>The servant girl at the door said to Peter, “You also are not one of this man's disciples, are you?” He said, “I am not.”</span> <span class=\"text John-18-18\" id=\"en-ESV-26792\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves. Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-18-19\" id=\"en-ESV-26793\">The High Priest Questions Jesus</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-18-19\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</span> <span class=\"text John-18-20\" id=\"en-ESV-26794\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Jesus answered him, <span class=\"woj\">“I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-18-21\" id=\"en-ESV-26795\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them; they know what I said.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-18-22\" id=\"en-ESV-26796\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>When he had said these things, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, “Is that how you answer the high priest?”</span> <span class=\"text John-18-23\" id=\"en-ESV-26797\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>Jesus answered him, <span class=\"woj\">“If what I said is wrong, bear witness about the wrong; but if what I said is right, why do you strike me?”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-18-24\" id=\"en-ESV-26798\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-18-25\" id=\"en-ESV-26799\">Peter Denies Jesus Again</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-18-25\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, “You also are not one of his disciples, are you?” He denied it and said, “I am not.”</span> <span class=\"text John-18-26\" id=\"en-ESV-26800\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, “Did I not see you in the garden with him?”</span> <span class=\"text John-18-27\" id=\"en-ESV-26801\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Peter again denied it, and at once a rooster crowed.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-18-28\" id=\"en-ESV-26802\">Jesus Before Pilate</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-18-28\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the governor's headquarters. It was early morning. They themselves did not enter the governor's headquarters, so that they would not be defiled, but could eat the Passover.</span> <span class=\"text John-18-29\" id=\"en-ESV-26803\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>So Pilate went outside to them and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”</span> <span class=\"text John-18-30\" id=\"en-ESV-26804\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>They answered him, “If this man were not doing evil, we would not have delivered him over to you.”</span> <span class=\"text John-18-31\" id=\"en-ESV-26805\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.” The Jews said to him, “It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.”</span> <span class=\"text John-18-32\" id=\"en-ESV-26806\"><sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken to show by what kind of death he was going to die.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-18-33\" id=\"en-ESV-26807\">My Kingdom Is Not of This World</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-18-33\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>So Pilate entered his headquarters again and called Jesus and said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”</span> <span class=\"text John-18-34\" id=\"en-ESV-26808\"><sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>Jesus answered, <span class=\"woj\">“Do you say this of your own accord, or did others say it to you about me?”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-18-35\" id=\"en-ESV-26809\"><sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>Pilate answered, “Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me. What have you done?”</span> <span class=\"text John-18-36\" id=\"en-ESV-26810\"><sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>Jesus answered, <span class=\"woj\">“My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-18-37\" id=\"en-ESV-26811\"><sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>Then Pilate said to him, “So you are a king?” Jesus answered, <span class=\"woj\">“You say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come into the world—to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-18-38\" id=\"en-ESV-26812\"><sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>Pilate said to him, “What is truth?”</span></p><p><span class=\"text John-18-38\">After he had said this, he went back outside to the Jews and told them, “I find no guilt in him.</span> <span class=\"text John-18-39\" id=\"en-ESV-26813\"><sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”</span> <span class=\"text John-18-40\" id=\"en-ESV-26814\"><sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>They cried out again, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a robber.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-19-1\" id=\"en-ESV-26815\">Jesus Delivered to Be Crucified</span></h3><p class=\"chapter-2\"><span class=\"text John-19-1\"><span class=\"chapternum\">19 </span>Then Pilate took Jesus and flogged him.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-2\" id=\"en-ESV-26816\"><sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrayed him in a purple robe.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-3\" id=\"en-ESV-26817\"><sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>They came up to him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and struck him with their hands.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-4\" id=\"en-ESV-26818\"><sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>Pilate went out again and said to them, “See, I am bringing him out to you that you may know that I find no guilt in him.”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-5\" id=\"en-ESV-26819\"><sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, “Behold the man!”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-6\" id=\"en-ESV-26820\"><sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, “Crucify him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no guilt in him.”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-7\" id=\"en-ESV-26821\"><sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he has made himself the Son of God.”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-8\" id=\"en-ESV-26822\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-9\" id=\"en-ESV-26823\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>He entered his headquarters again and said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-10\" id=\"en-ESV-26824\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>So Pilate said to him, “You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-11\" id=\"en-ESV-26825\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Jesus answered him, <span class=\"woj\">“You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above. Therefore he who delivered me over to you has the greater sin.”</span></span></p> <p><span class=\"text John-19-12\" id=\"en-ESV-26826\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>From then on Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, “If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-13\" id=\"en-ESV-26827\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Stone Pavement, and in Aramaic Gabbatha.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-14\" id=\"en-ESV-26828\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover. It was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, “Behold your King!”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-15\" id=\"en-ESV-26829\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>They cried out, “Away with him, away with him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar.”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-16\" id=\"en-ESV-26830\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>So he delivered him over to them to be crucified.</span></p><h3><span class=\"text John-19-16\">The Crucifixion</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-19-16\">So they took Jesus,</span> <span class=\"text John-19-17\" id=\"en-ESV-26831\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-18\" id=\"en-ESV-26832\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-19\" id=\"en-ESV-26833\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-20\" id=\"en-ESV-26834\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-21\" id=\"en-ESV-26835\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but rather, ‘This man said, I am King of the Jews.’”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-22\" id=\"en-ESV-26836\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Pilate answered, “What I have written I have written.”</span></p> <p><span class=\"text John-19-23\" id=\"en-ESV-26837\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom,</span> <span class=\"text John-19-24\" id=\"en-ESV-26838\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>so they said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.” This was to fulfill the Scripture which says,</span></p><div class=\"poetry top-1\"><p class=\"line\"><span class=\"text John-19-24\">“They divided my garments among them,</span><br/><span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text John-19-24\">and for my clothing they cast lots.”</span></span></p></div><p class=\"first-line-none top-1\"><span class=\"text John-19-24\">So the soldiers did these things,</span> <span class=\"text John-19-25\" id=\"en-ESV-26839\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-26\" id=\"en-ESV-26840\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, <span class=\"woj\">“Woman, behold, your son!”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-19-27\" id=\"en-ESV-26841\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Then he said to the disciple, <span class=\"woj\">“Behold, your mother!”</span> And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-19-28\" id=\"en-ESV-26842\">The Death of Jesus</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-19-28\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfill the Scripture), <span class=\"woj\">“I thirst.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-19-29\" id=\"en-ESV-26843\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>A jar full of sour wine stood there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-30\" id=\"en-ESV-26844\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, <span class=\"woj\">“It is finished,”</span> and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-19-31\" id=\"en-ESV-26845\">Jesus' Side Is Pierced</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-19-31\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>Since it was the day of Preparation, and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-32\" id=\"en-ESV-26846\"><sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-33\" id=\"en-ESV-26847\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-34\" id=\"en-ESV-26848\"><sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-35\" id=\"en-ESV-26849\"><sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>He who saw it has borne witness—his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth—that you also may believe.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-36\" id=\"en-ESV-26850\"><sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: “Not one of his bones will be broken.”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-37\" id=\"en-ESV-26851\"><sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>And again another Scripture says, “They will look on him whom they have pierced.”</span></p>  <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div> \n"
