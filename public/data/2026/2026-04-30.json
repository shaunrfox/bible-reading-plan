        "biography": "<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The two apostles commemorated on this day are among those about whom little is known, except for their mention in the Gospels. James the Less is so called to distinguish him from James the son of Zebedee or perhaps to indicate youth or lack of stature. He is known to us from the list of the Twelve, where he is called James the son of Alpheus. He may also be the person referred to in Mark&rsquo;s Gospel as James the younger, who, with his mother Mary and the other women, watched the crucifixion from a distance.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Papias of Rome (d. circa 100) and St. Jermone (347-420) identified James the Less as the same person as James the Just, or James of Jerusalem, the Brother of our Lord. This is the traditional belief of Roman Catholics and many Anglicans. Some Anglicans (including the ACNA) follow the Eastern Orthodox tradition which considers James, the Brother of Jesus, to be a separate person whose feast is celebrated on October 23.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Philip figures in several important incidents in Jesus&rsquo; ministry as reported in John&rsquo;s Gospel. There we read that Jesus called Philip soon after calling Andrew and Peter. Philip, in turn, found his friend Nathanael, and convinced him to come and see Jesus, the Messiah. Later, when Jesus saw the hungry crowd, he asked Philip, &ldquo;How are we to buy bread, so that these people may eat?&rdquo; (John 6:5). Philip&rsquo;s practical response, &ldquo;Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each of them to get a little&rdquo; (John 6:7), was the prelude to the feeding of the multitude with the loaves and fishes. In a later incident in John&rsquo;s Gospel, some Greeks came to Philip asking to see Jesus. At the Last Supper, Philip&rsquo;s request, &ldquo;Lord, show us the Father, and we shall be satisfied,&rdquo; evokes the response, &ldquo;Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father&rdquo; (John 14:8,9)</span></p>",
