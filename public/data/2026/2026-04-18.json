Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-24-22\" id=\"en-ESV-26003\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning,</span> <span class=\"text Luke-24-23\" id=\"en-ESV-26004\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-24-24\" id=\"en-ESV-26005\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.”</span> <span class=\"text Luke-24-25\" id=\"en-ESV-26006\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>And he said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-24-26\" id=\"en-ESV-26007\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?”</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-24-27\" id=\"en-ESV-26008\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Luke-24-28\" id=\"en-ESV-26009\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther,</span> <span class=\"text Luke-24-29\" id=\"en-ESV-26010\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>but they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.” So he went in to stay with them.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-24-30\" id=\"en-ESV-26011\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-24-31\" id=\"en-ESV-26012\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-24-32\" id=\"en-ESV-26013\"><sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>They said to each other, “Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?”</span> <span class=\"text Luke-24-33\" id=\"en-ESV-26014\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together,</span> <span class=\"text Luke-24-34\" id=\"en-ESV-26015\"><sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>saying, “The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!”</span> <span class=\"text Luke-24-35\" id=\"en-ESV-26016\"><sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",
