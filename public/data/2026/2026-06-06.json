For there is no distinction:</span> <span class=\"text Rom-3-23\" id=\"en-ESV-27999\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</span> <span class=\"text Rom-3-24\" id=\"en-ESV-28000\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</span> <span class=\"text Rom-3-25\" id=\"en-ESV-28001\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-3-26\" id=\"en-ESV-28002\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Rom-3-27\" id=\"en-ESV-28003\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-3-28\" id=\"en-ESV-28004\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-3-29\" id=\"en-ESV-28005\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,</span> <span class=\"text Rom-3-30\" id=\"en-ESV-28006\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>since God is one—who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-3-31\" id=\"en-ESV-28007\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.</span></p> \n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div> \n"
