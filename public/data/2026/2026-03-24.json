        "biography": "<p><strong>Painting:</strong> <em>Mary Comforts Eve </em>by Sister Grace Remington, OCSO, from the Sisters of the Mississippi Abbey in Dubuque, Iowa</p>\n\n<p>The annunciation commemorates the announcement by the Archangel Gabriel to Blessed Virgin Mary&nbsp;that she would conceive&nbsp;by the Holy Spirit and become the mother of God. This is the true feast of the Incarnation (rather than Christmas), marking the time when the Son took on flesh in Mary&#39;s womb. The Annunciation was traditionally keep as the beginning of the new year, and remained as New Year&#39;s Day in France until 1564 and England until 1752.</p>\n\n<p>Today&rsquo;s feast commemorates how God made known to a young Jewish woman that she was to be the mother of his Son, and how Mary accepted her vocation with perfect conformity of will. It has been said, &ldquo;God made us without us, and redeemed us without us, but cannot save us without us.&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s assent to Gabriel&rsquo;s message opened the way for God to accomplish the salvation of the world. It is for this reason that all generations are to call her &ldquo;blessed (Luke 1:48).&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The Annunciation has been a major theme in Christian art, in both East and West. Innumerable sermons and poems have been composed about it. The term coined by Cyril of Alexandria for the Blessed Virgin, Theotokos (&ldquo;the God-bearer&rdquo; or less literally &quot;Mother of God&quot;), was affirmed by the General Council of Ephesus in 431.</p>\n\n<p>Mary&rsquo;s self-offering in response to God&rsquo;s call has been compared to that of Abraham, the father of believers. Just as Abraham was called to be the father of the chosen people, and accepted his call, so Mary was called to be the mother of the faithful, the new Israel. She is God&rsquo;s human agent in the mystery of the Incarnation. Her response to the angel, &ldquo;Let it be to me according to your word,&rdquo; is identical with the faith expressed in the prayer that Jesus taught, &ldquo;Your will be done on earth as in heaven.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Traditions</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Waffles:&nbsp;I</em>n Sweden, Christians will eat waffles on&nbsp;the Feast of the Annunciation, because the feast&rsquo;s name, in Swedish, is called&nbsp;<em>V&aring;rfrudagen</em>&nbsp;(&ldquo;Our Lady&rsquo;s Day&rdquo;), similar to&nbsp;<em>V&aring;ffeldagen&nbsp;</em>(Waffle Day). This serves as a break from the Lenten observance of abstaining from fats, oils, and sweets.</p>\n\n<p><em>A rather important day:</em>&nbsp;Ancient tradition holds that March 25 was not only the day Christ was conceived, but also the day the world was created, Lucifer was cast into hell, the one&nbsp;ring&nbsp;was destroyed, Adam and Eve fell, Abraham nearly&nbsp;sacrificed his son Isaac, the Israelites crossed the Red Sea, and Our Lord was crucified.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-11-10\" id=\"en-ESV-26522\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-11-11\" id=\"en-ESV-26523\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>After saying these things, he said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-11-12\" id=\"en-ESV-26524\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>The disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.”</span> <span class=\"text John-11-13\" id=\"en-ESV-26525\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep.</span> <span class=\"text John-11-14\" id=\"en-ESV-26526\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Then Jesus told them plainly, <span class=\"woj\">“Lazarus has died,</span></span> <span class=\"text John-11-15\" id=\"en-ESV-26527\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-11-16\" id=\"en-ESV-26528\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>So Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.”</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-11-17\" id=\"en-ESV-26529\">I Am the Resurrection and the Life</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-11-17\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Now when Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days.</span> <span class=\"text John-11-18\" id=\"en-ESV-26530\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off,</span> <span class=\"text John-11-19\" id=\"en-ESV-26531\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother.</span> <span class=\"text John-11-20\" id=\"en-ESV-26532\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary remained seated in the house.</span> <span class=\"text John-11-21\" id=\"en-ESV-26533\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</span> <span class=\"text John-11-22\" id=\"en-ESV-26534\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you.”</span> <span class=\"text John-11-23\" id=\"en-ESV-26535\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>Jesus said to her, <span class=\"woj\">“Your brother will rise again.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-11-24\" id=\"en-ESV-26536\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.”</span> <span class=\"text John-11-25\" id=\"en-ESV-26537\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>Jesus said to her, <span class=\"woj\">“I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live,</span></span> <span class=\"text John-11-26\" id=\"en-ESV-26538\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-11-27\" id=\"en-ESV-26539\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>She said to him, “Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world.”</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-11-28\" id=\"en-ESV-26540\">Jesus Weeps</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-11-28\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying in private, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.”</span> <span class=\"text John-11-29\" id=\"en-ESV-26541\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>And when she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him.</span> <span class=\"text John-11-30\" id=\"en-ESV-26542\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him.</span> <span class=\"text John-11-31\" id=\"en-ESV-26543\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>When the Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.</span> <span class=\"text John-11-32\" id=\"en-ESV-26544\"><sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”</span> <span class=\"text John-11-33\" id=\"en-ESV-26545\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled.</span> <span class=\"text John-11-34\" id=\"en-ESV-26546\"><sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>And he said, <span class=\"woj\">“Where have you laid him?”</span> They said to him, “Lord, come and see.”</span> <span class=\"text John-11-35\" id=\"en-ESV-26547\"><sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>Jesus wept.</span> <span class=\"text John-11-36\" id=\"en-ESV-26548\"><sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>So the Jews said, “See how he loved him!”</span> <span class=\"text John-11-37\" id=\"en-ESV-26549\"><sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>But some of them said, “Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man also have kept this man from dying?”</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-11-38\" id=\"en-ESV-26550\">Jesus Raises Lazarus</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-11-38\"><sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it.</span> <span class=\"text John-11-39\" id=\"en-ESV-26551\"><sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>Jesus said, <span class=\"woj\">“Take away the stone.”</span> Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, “Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead four days.”</span> <span class=\"text John-11-40\" id=\"en-ESV-26552\"><sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>Jesus said to her, <span class=\"woj\">“Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-11-41\" id=\"en-ESV-26553\"><sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, <span class=\"woj\">“Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-11-42\" id=\"en-ESV-26554\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that you sent me.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-11-43\" id=\"en-ESV-26555\"><sup class=\"versenum\">43 </sup>When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, <span class=\"woj\">“Lazarus, come out.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-11-44\" id=\"en-ESV-26556\"><sup class=\"versenum\">44 </sup>The man who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“Unbind him, and let him go.”</span></span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div> \n"
