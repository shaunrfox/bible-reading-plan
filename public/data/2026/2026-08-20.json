Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-14\" id=\"en-ESV-28208\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-15\" id=\"en-ESV-28209\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-16\" id=\"en-ESV-28210\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Rom-11-17\" id=\"en-ESV-28211\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree,</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-18\" id=\"en-ESV-28212\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-19\" id=\"en-ESV-28213\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Then you will say, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.”</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-20\" id=\"en-ESV-28214\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but fear.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-21\" id=\"en-ESV-28215\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-22\" id=\"en-ESV-28216\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-23\" id=\"en-ESV-28217\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-24\" id=\"en-ESV-28218\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree.</span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div> \n"
