Will he delay long over them?</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-8\" id=\"en-ESV-25687\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”</span></span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Luke-18-9\" id=\"en-ESV-25688\">The Pharisee and the Tax Collector</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Luke-18-9\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt:</span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-10\" id=\"en-ESV-25689\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>“Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-11\" id=\"en-ESV-25690\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-12\" id=\"en-ESV-25691\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.’</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-13\" id=\"en-ESV-25692\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-14\" id=\"en-ESV-25693\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”</span></span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Luke-18-15\" id=\"en-ESV-25694\">Let the Children Come to Me</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Luke-18-15\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Now they were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them. And when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-16\" id=\"en-ESV-25695\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>But Jesus called them to him, saying, <span class=\"woj\">“Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God.</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-17\" id=\"en-ESV-25696\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.”</span></span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Luke-18-18\" id=\"en-ESV-25697\">The Rich Ruler</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Luke-18-18\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>And a ruler asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”</span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-19\" id=\"en-ESV-25698\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>And Jesus said to him, <span class=\"woj\">“Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-20\" id=\"en-ESV-25699\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.’”</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-21\" id=\"en-ESV-25700\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>And he said, “All these I have kept from my youth.”</span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-22\" id=\"en-ESV-25701\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>When Jesus heard this, he said to him, <span class=\"woj\">“One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.”</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-23\" id=\"en-ESV-25702\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-24\" id=\"en-ESV-25703\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Jesus, seeing that he had become sad, said, <span class=\"woj\">“How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-25\" id=\"en-ESV-25704\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-26\" id=\"en-ESV-25705\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>Those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?”</span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-27\" id=\"en-ESV-25706\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>But he said, <span class=\"woj\">“What is impossible with man is possible with God.”</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-28\" id=\"en-ESV-25707\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>And Peter said, “See, we have left our homes and followed you.”</span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-29\" id=\"en-ESV-25708\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>And he said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-18-30\" id=\"en-ESV-25709\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life.”</span></span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",
