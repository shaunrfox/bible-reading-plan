He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Jonah-1-4\" id=\"en-ESV-22536\"><sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>But the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> hurled a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship threatened to break up.</span> <span class=\"text Jonah-1-5\" id=\"en-ESV-22537\"><sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Then the mariners were afraid, and each cried out to his god.

He acted as if he were going farther,</span> <span class=\"text Luke-24-29\" id=\"en-ESV-26010\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>but they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.” So he went in to stay with them.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-24-30\" id=\"en-ESV-26011\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-24-31\" id=\"en-ESV-26012\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-24-32\" id=\"en-ESV-26013\"><sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>They said to each other, “Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?”</span> <span class=\"text Luke-24-33\" id=\"en-ESV-26014\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem.

There are 50 days of Easter from the first Sunday to Pentecost. It is characterized, above all, by the joy of glorified life and the victory over death expressed most fully in the great resounding cry of the Christian: Alleluia!

The Vigil is not a short service. It marks time in the evening, while the people await the announcement of the Resurrection: &quot;Alleluia. Christ is risen!&quot; He is risen indeed, and the Paschal Candle burns as a sign of the presence of the resurrected Christ.</span></p>\n\n<p><em>For as by a man came death, by a man has come the resurrection of the dead.
