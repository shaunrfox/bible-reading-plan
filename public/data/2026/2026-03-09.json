They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips,</span> <span class=\"text Rom-1-30\" id=\"en-ESV-27945\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,</span> <span class=\"text Rom-1-31\" id=\"en-ESV-27946\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-1-32\" id=\"en-ESV-27947\"><sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>Though they know God's righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.</span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div> \n"
