He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock.”</span> <span class=\"text John-4-13\" id=\"en-ESV-26159\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Jesus said to her, <span class=\"woj\">“Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again,</span></span> <span class=\"text John-4-14\" id=\"en-ESV-26160\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again. The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-4-15\" id=\"en-ESV-26161\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.”</span></p> <p><span class=\"text John-4-16\" id=\"en-ESV-26162\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Jesus said to her, <span class=\"woj\">“Go, call your husband, and come here.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-4-17\" id=\"en-ESV-26163\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, <span class=\"woj\">“You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’;</span></span> <span class=\"text John-4-18\" id=\"en-ESV-26164\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-4-19\" id=\"en-ESV-26165\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>The woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</span> <span class=\"text John-4-20\" id=\"en-ESV-26166\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.”</span> <span class=\"text John-4-21\" id=\"en-ESV-26167\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Jesus said to her, <span class=\"woj\">“Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-4-22\" id=\"en-ESV-26168\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-4-23\" id=\"en-ESV-26169\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-4-24\" id=\"en-ESV-26170\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-4-25\" id=\"en-ESV-26171\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, he will tell us all things.”</span> <span class=\"text John-4-26\" id=\"en-ESV-26172\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>Jesus said to her, <span class=\"woj\">“I who speak to you am he.”</span></span></p> <p><span class=\"text John-4-27\" id=\"en-ESV-26173\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Just then his disciples came back. They marveled that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, “What do you seek?” or, “Why are you talking with her?”</span> <span class=\"text John-4-28\" id=\"en-ESV-26174\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people,</span> <span class=\"text John-4-29\" id=\"en-ESV-26175\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>“Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?”</span> <span class=\"text John-4-30\" id=\"en-ESV-26176\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>They went out of the town and were coming to him.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text John-4-31\" id=\"en-ESV-26177\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”</span> <span class=\"text John-4-32\" id=\"en-ESV-26178\"><sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>But he said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“I have food to eat that you do not know about.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-4-33\" id=\"en-ESV-26179\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>So the disciples said to one another, “Has anyone brought him something to eat?”</span> <span class=\"text John-4-34\" id=\"en-ESV-26180\"><sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>Jesus said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-4-35\" id=\"en-ESV-26181\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months, then comes the harvest’? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that the fields are white for harvest.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-4-36\" id=\"en-ESV-26182\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>Already</span> <span class=\"woj\">the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-4-37\" id=\"en-ESV-26183\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>For here the saying holds true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’</span></span> <span class=\"text John-4-38\" id=\"en-ESV-26184\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”</span></span></p> <p><span class=\"text John-4-39\" id=\"en-ESV-26185\"><sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, “He told me all that I ever did.”</span> <span class=\"text John-4-40\" id=\"en-ESV-26186\"><sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.</span> <span class=\"text John-4-41\" id=\"en-ESV-26187\"><sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>And many more believed because of his word.</span> <span class=\"text John-4-42\" id=\"en-ESV-26188\"><sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.”</span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div> \n"
