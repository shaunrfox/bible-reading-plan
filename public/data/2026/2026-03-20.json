Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided for myself a king among his sons.”</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-16-2\" id=\"en-ESV-7598\"><sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>And Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.” And the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span> said, “Take a heifer with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>.’</span> <span class=\"text 1Sam-16-3\" id=\"en-ESV-7599\"><sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>And invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do.

Now he was ruddy and had beautiful eyes and was handsome.
