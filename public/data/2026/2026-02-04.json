So, if you seek me, let these men go.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-18-9\" id=\"en-ESV-26783\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken: <span class=\"woj\">“Of those whom you gave me I have lost not one.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-18-10\" id=\"en-ESV-26784\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.)</span> <span class=\"text John-18-11\" id=\"en-ESV-26785\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>So Jesus said to Peter, <span class=\"woj\">“Put your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?”</span></span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-18-12\" id=\"en-ESV-26786\">Jesus Faces Annas and Caiaphas</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-18-12\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>So the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him.</span> <span class=\"text John-18-13\" id=\"en-ESV-26787\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>First they led him to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</span> <span class=\"text John-18-14\" id=\"en-ESV-26788\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>It was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it would be expedient that one man should die for the people.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-18-15\" id=\"en-ESV-26789\">Peter Denies Jesus</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-18-15\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest,</span> <span class=\"text John-18-16\" id=\"en-ESV-26790\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>but Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the servant girl who kept watch at the door, and brought Peter in.</span> <span class=\"text John-18-17\" id=\"en-ESV-26791\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>The servant girl at the door said to Peter, “You also are not one of this man's disciples, are you?” He said, “I am not.”</span> <span class=\"text John-18-18\" id=\"en-ESV-26792\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves. Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-18-19\" id=\"en-ESV-26793\">The High Priest Questions Jesus</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-18-19\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</span> <span class=\"text John-18-20\" id=\"en-ESV-26794\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Jesus answered him, <span class=\"woj\">“I have spoken openly to the world. I have always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews come together. I have said nothing in secret.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-18-21\" id=\"en-ESV-26795\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them; they know what I said.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-18-22\" id=\"en-ESV-26796\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>When he had said these things, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, “Is that how you answer the high priest?”</span> <span class=\"text John-18-23\" id=\"en-ESV-26797\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>Jesus answered him, <span class=\"woj\">“If what I said is wrong, bear witness about the wrong; but if what I said is right, why do you strike me?”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-18-24\" id=\"en-ESV-26798\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-18-25\" id=\"en-ESV-26799\">Peter Denies Jesus Again</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-18-25\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, “You also are not one of his disciples, are you?” He denied it and said, “I am not.”</span> <span class=\"text John-18-26\" id=\"en-ESV-26800\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, “Did I not see you in the garden with him?”</span> <span class=\"text John-18-27\" id=\"en-ESV-26801\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Peter again denied it, and at once a rooster crowed.</span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",
