        "biography": "<p><strong>Painting:</strong> <em>Mary Comforts Eve </em>by Sister Grace Remington, OCSO, from the Sisters of the Mississippi Abbey in Dubuque, Iowa</p>\n\n<p>The annunciation commemorates the announcement by the Archangel Gabriel to Blessed Virgin Mary&nbsp;that she would conceive&nbsp;by the Holy Spirit and become the mother of God. This is the true feast of the Incarnation (rather than Christmas), marking the time when the Son took on flesh in Mary&#39;s womb. The Annunciation was traditionally keep as the beginning of the new year, and remained as New Year&#39;s Day in France until 1564 and England until 1752.</p>\n\n<p>Today&rsquo;s feast commemorates how God made known to a young Jewish woman that she was to be the mother of his Son, and how Mary accepted her vocation with perfect conformity of will. It has been said, &ldquo;God made us without us, and redeemed us without us, but cannot save us without us.&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s assent to Gabriel&rsquo;s message opened the way for God to accomplish the salvation of the world. It is for this reason that all generations are to call her &ldquo;blessed (Luke 1:48).&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The Annunciation has been a major theme in Christian art, in both East and West. Innumerable sermons and poems have been composed about it. The term coined by Cyril of Alexandria for the Blessed Virgin, Theotokos (&ldquo;the God-bearer&rdquo; or less literally &quot;Mother of God&quot;), was affirmed by the General Council of Ephesus in 431.</p>\n\n<p>Mary&rsquo;s self-offering in response to God&rsquo;s call has been compared to that of Abraham, the father of believers. Just as Abraham was called to be the father of the chosen people, and accepted his call, so Mary was called to be the mother of the faithful, the new Israel. She is God&rsquo;s human agent in the mystery of the Incarnation. Her response to the angel, &ldquo;Let it be to me according to your word,&rdquo; is identical with the faith expressed in the prayer that Jesus taught, &ldquo;Your will be done on earth as in heaven.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Traditions</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Waffles:&nbsp;I</em>n Sweden, Christians will eat waffles on&nbsp;the Feast of the Annunciation, because the feast&rsquo;s name, in Swedish, is called&nbsp;<em>V&aring;rfrudagen</em>&nbsp;(&ldquo;Our Lady&rsquo;s Day&rdquo;), similar to&nbsp;<em>V&aring;ffeldagen&nbsp;</em>(Waffle Day). This serves as a break from the Lenten observance of abstaining from fats, oils, and sweets.</p>\n\n<p><em>A rather important day:</em>&nbsp;Ancient tradition holds that March 25 was not only the day Christ was conceived, but also the day the world was created, Lucifer was cast into hell, the one&nbsp;ring&nbsp;was destroyed, Adam and Eve fell, Abraham nearly&nbsp;sacrificed his son Isaac, the Israelites crossed the Red Sea, and Our Lord was crucified.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
