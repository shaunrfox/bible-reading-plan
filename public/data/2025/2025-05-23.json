Whether it is love or hate, man does not know; both are before him.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-9-2\" id=\"en-ESV-17478\"><sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>It is the same for all, since the same event happens to the righteous and the wicked, to the good and the evil, to the clean and the unclean, to him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice. As the good one is, so is the sinner, and he who swears is as he who shuns an oath.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-9-3\" id=\"en-ESV-17479\"><sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that the same event happens to all.

Like fish that are taken in an evil net, and like birds that are caught in a snare, so the children of man are snared at an evil time, when it suddenly falls upon them.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Eccl-9-13\" id=\"en-ESV-17489\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-9-14\" id=\"en-ESV-17490\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>There was a little city with few men in it, and a great king came against it and besieged it, building great siegeworks against it.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-9-15\" id=\"en-ESV-17491\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>But there was found in it a poor, wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that poor man.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-9-16\" id=\"en-ESV-17492\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>But I say that wisdom is better than might, though the poor man's wisdom is despised and his words are not heard.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Eccl-9-17\" id=\"en-ESV-17493\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-9-18\" id=\"en-ESV-17494\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.</span></p>  <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",
