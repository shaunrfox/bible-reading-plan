He is honored in Christian tradition for the nurturing care and protection he provided for the infant Jesus and his mother in taking them to Egypt to escape Herod&rsquo;s slaughter of the innocents, and in rearing him as a faithful Jew at Nazareth. The Gospel according to Matthew pictures Joseph as a man of deep devotion, open to mystical experiences, and as a man of compassion, who accepted his Godgiven responsibility with gentleness and humility.</p>\n\n<p>Joseph was a pious Jew, a descendant of David, and a carpenter by trade. As Joseph the Carpenter, he is considered the patron saint of the working man, one who not only worked with his hands, but taught his trade to Jesus. The little that is told of him is a testimony to the trust in God which values simple everyday duties, and gives an example of a loving husband and father.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Traditions</strong></p>\n\n<p>- Giving food to the poor</p>\n\n<p>- Eating food containing bread crumbs to symbolize saw dust, since Joseph was a carpenter</p>\n\n<p>- St. Jospeh&#39;s Day Altars:&nbsp;Elaborate altars are divided&nbsp;into three sections representing the three persons of the Trinity with&nbsp;a statue of Joseph.
