For if many died through one man's trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-5-16\" id=\"en-ESV-28048\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-5-17\" id=\"en-ESV-28049\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>For if, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Rom-5-18\" id=\"en-ESV-28050\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-5-19\" id=\"en-ESV-28051\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-5-20\" id=\"en-ESV-28052\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,</span> <span class=\"text Rom-5-21\" id=\"en-ESV-28053\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></p>  <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",
