Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted.</span> <span class=\"text Gal-6-2\" id=\"en-ESV-29174\"><sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</span> <span class=\"text Gal-6-3\" id=\"en-ESV-29175\"><sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</span> <span class=\"text Gal-6-4\" id=\"en-ESV-29176\"><sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>But let each one test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor.</span> <span class=\"text Gal-6-5\" id=\"en-ESV-29177\"><sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>For each will have to bear his own load.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Gal-6-6\" id=\"en-ESV-29178\"><sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>Let the one who is taught the word share all good things with the one who teaches.</span> <span class=\"text Gal-6-7\" id=\"en-ESV-29179\"><sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap.</span> <span class=\"text Gal-6-8\" id=\"en-ESV-29180\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.</span> <span class=\"text Gal-6-9\" id=\"en-ESV-29181\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.</span> <span class=\"text Gal-6-10\" id=\"en-ESV-29182\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Gal-6-11\" id=\"en-ESV-29183\">Final Warning and Benediction</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Gal-6-11\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand.</span> <span class=\"text Gal-6-12\" id=\"en-ESV-29184\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh who would force you to be circumcised, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</span> <span class=\"text Gal-6-13\" id=\"en-ESV-29185\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.</span> <span class=\"text Gal-6-14\" id=\"en-ESV-29186\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</span> <span class=\"text Gal-6-15\" id=\"en-ESV-29187\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>For neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</span> <span class=\"text Gal-6-16\" id=\"en-ESV-29188\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>And as for all who walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Gal-6-17\" id=\"en-ESV-29189\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Gal-6-18\" id=\"en-ESV-29190\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.
