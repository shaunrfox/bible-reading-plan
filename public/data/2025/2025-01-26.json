He laid aside his outer garments, and taking a towel, tied it around his waist.</span> <span class=\"text John-13-5\" id=\"en-ESV-26624\"><sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.</span> <span class=\"text John-13-6\" id=\"en-ESV-26625\"><sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?”</span> <span class=\"text John-13-7\" id=\"en-ESV-26626\"><sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Jesus answered him, <span class=\"woj\">“What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-13-8\" id=\"en-ESV-26627\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>Peter said to him, “You shall never wash my feet.” Jesus answered him, <span class=\"woj\">“If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-13-9\" id=\"en-ESV-26628\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only but also my hands and my head!”</span> <span class=\"text John-13-10\" id=\"en-ESV-26629\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Jesus said to him, <span class=\"woj\">“The one who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not every one of you.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-13-11\" id=\"en-ESV-26630\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, <span class=\"woj\">“Not all of you are clean.”</span></span></p> <p><span class=\"text John-13-12\" id=\"en-ESV-26631\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments and resumed his place, he said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“Do you understand what I have done to you?</span></span> <span class=\"text John-13-13\" id=\"en-ESV-26632\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-13-14\" id=\"en-ESV-26633\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-13-15\" id=\"en-ESV-26634\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>For I have given you an example, that you also should do just as I have done to you.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-13-16\" id=\"en-ESV-26635\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-13-17\" id=\"en-ESV-26636\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-13-18\" id=\"en-ESV-26637\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>I am not speaking of all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But the Scripture will be fulfilled, ‘He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.’</span></span> <span class=\"text John-13-19\" id=\"en-ESV-26638\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>I am telling you this now, before it takes place, that when it does take place you may believe that I am he.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-13-20\" id=\"en-ESV-26639\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever receives the one I send receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.”</span></span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-13-21\" id=\"en-ESV-26640\">One of You Will Betray Me</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-13-21\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>After saying these things, Jesus was troubled in his spirit, and testified, <span class=\"woj\">“Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-13-22\" id=\"en-ESV-26641\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke.</span> <span class=\"text John-13-23\" id=\"en-ESV-26642\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining at table at Jesus' side,</span> <span class=\"text John-13-24\" id=\"en-ESV-26643\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>so Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking.</span> <span class=\"text John-13-25\" id=\"en-ESV-26644\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>So that disciple, leaning back against Jesus, said to him, “Lord, who is it?”</span> <span class=\"text John-13-26\" id=\"en-ESV-26645\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>Jesus answered, <span class=\"woj\">“It is he to whom I will give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it.”</span> So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.</span> <span class=\"text John-13-27\" id=\"en-ESV-26646\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Then after he had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, <span class=\"woj\">“What you are going to do, do quickly.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-13-28\" id=\"en-ESV-26647\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him.</span> <span class=\"text John-13-29\" id=\"en-ESV-26648\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>Some thought that, because Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him, “Buy what we need for the feast,” or that he should give something to the poor.</span> <span class=\"text John-13-30\" id=\"en-ESV-26649\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>So, after receiving the morsel of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-13-31\" id=\"en-ESV-26650\">A New Commandment</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-13-31\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>When he had gone out, Jesus said, <span class=\"woj\">“Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-13-32\" id=\"en-ESV-26651\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-13-33\" id=\"en-ESV-26652\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.’</span></span> <span class=\"text John-13-34\" id=\"en-ESV-26653\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-13-35\" id=\"en-ESV-26654\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”</span></span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-13-36\" id=\"en-ESV-26655\">Jesus Foretells Peter's Denial</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-13-36\"><sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus answered him, <span class=\"woj\">“Where I am going you cannot follow me now, but you will follow afterward.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-13-37\" id=\"en-ESV-26656\"><sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>Peter said to him, “Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.”</span> <span class=\"text John-13-38\" id=\"en-ESV-26657\"><sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>Jesus answered, <span class=\"woj\">“Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow till you have denied me three times.</span></span></p>  <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",
