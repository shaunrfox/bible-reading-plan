In the presence of our kinsmen point out what I have that is yours, and take it.” Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Gen-31-33\" id=\"en-ESV-907\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah's tent and entered Rachel's.</span> <span class=\"text Gen-31-34\" id=\"en-ESV-908\"><sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel's saddle and sat on them.

Jacob said to Laban, “What is my offense?

I bore the loss of it myself. From my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.</span> <span class=\"text Gen-31-40\" id=\"en-ESV-914\"><sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>There I was: by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.</span> <span class=\"text Gen-31-41\" id=\"en-ESV-915\"><sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.</span> <span class=\"text Gen-31-42\" id=\"en-ESV-916\"><sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God saw my affliction and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night.”</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Gen-31-43\" id=\"en-ESV-917\"><sup class=\"versenum\">43 </sup>Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne?</span> <span class=\"text Gen-31-44\" id=\"en-ESV-918\"><sup class=\"versenum\">44 </sup>Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I. And let it be a witness between you and me.”</span> <span class=\"text Gen-31-45\" id=\"en-ESV-919\"><sup class=\"versenum\">45 </sup>So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.</span> </p>\n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",
