And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.</span> <span class=\"text John-2-16\" id=\"en-ESV-26101\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>And he told those who sold the pigeons, <span class=\"woj\">“Take these things away; do not make my Father's house a house of trade.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-2-17\" id=\"en-ESV-26102\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”</span></p> <p><span class=\"text John-2-18\" id=\"en-ESV-26103\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>So the Jews said to him, “What sign do you show us for doing these things?”</span> <span class=\"text John-2-19\" id=\"en-ESV-26104\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Jesus answered them, <span class=\"woj\">“Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-2-20\" id=\"en-ESV-26105\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>The Jews then said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?”</span> <span class=\"text John-2-21\" id=\"en-ESV-26106\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>But he was speaking about the temple of his body.</span> <span class=\"text John-2-22\" id=\"en-ESV-26107\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-2-23\" id=\"en-ESV-26108\">Jesus Knows What Is in Man</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-2-23\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he was doing.</span> <span class=\"text John-2-24\" id=\"en-ESV-26109\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>But Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people</span> <span class=\"text John-2-25\" id=\"en-ESV-26110\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>and needed no one to bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was in man.</span></p>  <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",
