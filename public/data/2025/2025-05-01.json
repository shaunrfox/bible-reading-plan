Later, when Jesus saw the hungry crowd, he asked Philip, &ldquo;How are we to buy bread, so that these people may eat?&rdquo; (John 6:5). Philip&rsquo;s practical response, &ldquo;Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each of them to get a little&rdquo; (John 6:7), was the prelude to the feeding of the multitude with the loaves and fishes. In a later incident in John&rsquo;s Gospel, some Greeks came to Philip asking to see Jesus. At the Last Supper, Philip&rsquo;s request, &ldquo;Lord, show us the Father, and we shall be satisfied,&rdquo; evokes the response, &ldquo;Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father&rdquo; (John 14:8,9)</span></p>",
