So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.</span> <span class=\"text Acts-9-9\" id=\"en-ESV-27213\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Acts-9-10\" id=\"en-ESV-27214\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, <span class=\"woj\">“Ananias.”</span> And he said, “Here I am, Lord.”</span> <span class=\"text Acts-9-11\" id=\"en-ESV-27215\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>And the Lord said to him, <span class=\"woj\">“Rise and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying,</span></span> <span class=\"text Acts-9-12\" id=\"en-ESV-27216\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.”</span></span> <span class=\"text Acts-9-13\" id=\"en-ESV-27217\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem.</span> <span class=\"text Acts-9-14\" id=\"en-ESV-27218\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.”</span> <span class=\"text Acts-9-15\" id=\"en-ESV-27219\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>But the Lord said to him, <span class=\"woj\">“Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel.</span></span> <span class=\"text Acts-9-16\" id=\"en-ESV-27220\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.”</span></span> <span class=\"text Acts-9-17\" id=\"en-ESV-27221\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>So Ananias departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”</span> <span class=\"text Acts-9-18\" id=\"en-ESV-27222\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight.

They were watching the gates day and night in order to kill him,</span> <span class=\"text Acts-9-25\" id=\"en-ESV-27229\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Acts-9-26\" id=\"en-ESV-27230\">Saul in Jerusalem</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Acts-9-26\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>And when he had come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join the disciples. And they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple.</span> <span class=\"text Acts-9-27\" id=\"en-ESV-27231\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who spoke to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class=\"text Acts-9-28\" id=\"en-ESV-27232\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem, preaching boldly in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class=\"text Acts-9-29\" id=\"en-ESV-27233\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists. But they were seeking to kill him.</span> <span class=\"text Acts-9-30\" id=\"en-ESV-27234\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>And when the brothers learned this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Acts-9-31\" id=\"en-ESV-27235\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was being built up.
