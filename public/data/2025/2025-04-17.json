At the Last Supper, Jesus washed his disciples&rsquo; feet and commanded them to love and serve one another as he had done. The service begins with a festal character: white vestments are worn. The </span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><em>Gloria in excelsis,</em></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"> which is otherwise omitted during Lent, is sung while bells are rung. Additional candles may be lit. This service has been called &ldquo;a burst of sunshine in the gathering gloom.&rdquo;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The tone changes after the Gloria. Traditionally no musical instruments of any kind are played after the Gloria of Maundy Thursday until the Alleluia at the first Eucahrist of Easter. A service of contrasts, we at once remember the joy of the institution of the Eucharist, the institution of the priesthood, the love and service which Jesus lived and taught, the agony in the garden of Gethsemane, and the betrayal leading to the crucifixion.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The bread and wine of the Last Supper are given new meaning by the Body broken and Blood poured out on the cross. Sufficient bread&nbsp;may be consecrated on this day for the Eucharist of the Presanctified on Good Friday. The Sacrament is then taken to an altar of repose where the faithful are asked to &ldquo;watch and pray&rdquo; throughout the night just as the disciples were invited to stay up with the Lord during His agony in the garden before His betrayal by Judas.&nbsp; The high altar, symbolic of Christ, is stripped of its vesture and the building is left bare for the solemnity of Good Friday.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Around the world, Bishops and priests come together at their local cathedrals on Maundy Thursday morning to celebrate the institution of the priesthood at the Chrism Eucharist. During the Eucharist, the bishop blesses 1) the Oil of Chrism that will be used for Baptisms, Confirmations, Ordinations, the consecration of a new church, and (exceptionally infrequently in the United States) the anointing of monarchs 2) the Oil of the Catechumens that will be used before baptisms and 3)&nbsp;the Oil of the Sick which will be used to anoint the sick or dying</span></p>",

        "biography": "<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">This day receives its name from the </span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><em>mandatum</em></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"> or the &ldquo;new commandment&rdquo; given by our Lord. At the Last Supper, Jesus washed his disciples&rsquo; feet and commanded them to love and serve one another as he had done. The service begins with a festal character: white vestments are worn. The </span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><em>Gloria in excelsis,</em></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"> which is otherwise omitted during Lent, is sung while bells are rung. Additional candles may be lit. This service has been called &ldquo;a burst of sunshine in the gathering gloom.&rdquo;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The tone changes after the Gloria. Traditionally no musical instruments of any kind are played after the Gloria of Maundy Thursday until the Alleluia at the first Eucahrist of Easter. A service of contrasts, we at once remember the joy of the institution of the Eucharist, the institution of the priesthood, the love and service which Jesus lived and taught, the agony in the garden of Gethsemane, and the betrayal leading to the crucifixion.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The bread and wine of the Last Supper are given new meaning by the Body broken and Blood poured out on the cross. Sufficient bread&nbsp;may be consecrated on this day for the Eucharist of the Presanctified on Good Friday. The Sacrament is then taken to an altar of repose where the faithful are asked to &ldquo;watch and pray&rdquo; throughout the night just as the disciples were invited to stay up with the Lord during His agony in the garden before His betrayal by Judas.&nbsp; The high altar, symbolic of Christ, is stripped of its vesture and the building is left bare for the solemnity of Good Friday.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Around the world, Bishops and priests come together at their local cathedrals on Maundy Thursday morning to celebrate the institution of the priesthood at the Chrism Eucharist. During the Eucharist, the bishop blesses 1) the Oil of Chrism that will be used for Baptisms, Confirmations, Ordinations, the consecration of a new church, and (exceptionally infrequently in the United States) the anointing of monarchs 2) the Oil of the Catechumens that will be used before baptisms and 3)&nbsp;the Oil of the Sick which will be used to anoint the sick or dying</span></p>",
