Turn in the account of your management, for you can no longer be manager.’</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-16-3\" id=\"en-ESV-25615\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>And the manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg.</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-16-4\" id=\"en-ESV-25616\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">4 </sup>I have decided what to do, so that when I am removed from management, people may receive me into their houses.’</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-16-5\" id=\"en-ESV-25617\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>So, summoning his master's debtors one by one, he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-16-6\" id=\"en-ESV-25618\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>He said, ‘A hundred measures of oil.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.’</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-16-7\" id=\"en-ESV-25619\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>Then he said to another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ He said, ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-16-8\" id=\"en-ESV-25620\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>The master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewdness.
