One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-7-42\" id=\"en-ESV-25229\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>When they could not pay, he cancelled the debt of both. Now which of them will love him more?”</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-7-43\" id=\"en-ESV-25230\"><sup class=\"versenum\">43 </sup>Simon answered, “The one, I suppose, for whom he cancelled the larger debt.” And he said to him, <span class=\"woj\">“You have judged rightly.”</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-7-44\" id=\"en-ESV-25231\"><sup class=\"versenum\">44 </sup>Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon, <span class=\"woj\">“Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-7-45\" id=\"en-ESV-25232\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">45 </sup>You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet.</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-7-46\" id=\"en-ESV-25233\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">46 </sup>You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-7-47\" id=\"en-ESV-25234\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">47 </sup>Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven—for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little.”</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-7-48\" id=\"en-ESV-25235\"><sup class=\"versenum\">48 </sup>And he said to her, <span class=\"woj\">“Your sins are forgiven.”</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-7-49\" id=\"en-ESV-25236\"><sup class=\"versenum\">49 </sup>Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves, “Who is this, who even forgives sins?”</span> <span class=\"text Luke-7-50\" id=\"en-ESV-25237\"><sup class=\"versenum\">50 </sup>And he said to the woman, <span class=\"woj\">“Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”</span></span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Luke-8-1\" id=\"en-ESV-25238\">Women Accompanying Jesus</span></h3><p class=\"chapter-1\"><span class=\"text Luke-8-1\"><span class=\"chapternum\">8 </span>Soon afterward he went on through cities and villages, proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. And the twelve were with him,</span> <span class=\"text Luke-8-2\" id=\"en-ESV-25239\"><sup class=\"versenum\">2 </sup>and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,</span> <span class=\"text Luke-8-3\" id=\"en-ESV-25240\"><sup class=\"versenum\">3 </sup>and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's household manager, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their means.</span></p>  <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div> \n"
