        "biography": "<p><strong>Painting: </strong><em>The Pieta </em>from&nbsp;Maxo Vanka&#39;s murals&nbsp;in St. Nicholas Croatian Catholic Church, Millvale (suburban Pittsburgh)</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">&ldquo;&lsquo;It is finished&rsquo;; and he bowed his head and handed over his spirit.&rdquo;</span></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?fbclid=IwAR348zInumqMPucf-GMOwkPaOePFQv2JCxb-2mhbKmBn_vS_LJRWtVSGr9I&amp;v=E_iPvOMeUzc&amp;feature=youtu.be\">View Way of the Cross: Meditation in Hymns video</a></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">This most solemn of all days should be marked by fasting, abstinence, and penance, leading us to focus on Jesus upon the cross. The bare, stark appearance of the church serves as a reminder of the solemnity and the sorrow of the day. The Lord of Life was rejected, mocked, scourged, and then put to death on the cross. The faithful need to be mindful of the part which their own sin played in this suffering and agony, as Christ took all sin upon himself, in obedience to his Father&rsquo;s will. By the cross we are redeemed, set free from bondage to sin and death. The cross is a sign of God&rsquo;s never-ending love for us. It is a sign of life, in the midst of death.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Traditionally, the organ is silent from Holy Thursday until the Alleluia at the Easter Vigil, as are all bells or other instruments, the only music during this period being unaccompanied chant.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The service on this day consists of three parts:</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">1) the lessons and solemn collects, including the chanted recitation of the passion by three deacons of different timbres and ranges: Christ, the narrator, and the crowds. The Passion tone, a distinct chant reserved for the passion, is used up until the passage where Jesus dies.&nbsp; Then it is replaced with the intensely sad Planctus (or Weeping) Tone.</span><a href=\"https://chantblog.blogspot.com/2011/04/planctus-tone-aka-holy-week-weeping.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"> </span><span style=\"color:#1155cc\"><u>Audio here</u></span></a></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">2) the veneration of the cross, a devotion showing our love and thankfulness for the gift of life given us by Jesus&rsquo; death, and the singing of the Solemn Reproaches.</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-i1VMXEMPzM\" style=\"text-decoration:none\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"> </span><span style=\"color:#1155cc\"><u>Audio here</u></span></a></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">3) the Eucharist of the Presanctified from the Sacrament consecrated on Maundy Thursday. No Eucharist is celebrated on this day, but Communion (in the species of bread) which had already been consecrated on Holy Thursday is given to the people.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">In all of these, we unite ourselves to our Savior, and we contemplate our own death to sin in the Death of our Lord.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The liturgical observance of this day of Christ&#39;s suffering, crucifixion and death evidently has been in existence from the earliest days of the Church. The pilgrim Egeria described her experience participating in the Veneration of the Cross in Jerusalem in the 300s in this way (not so different from today&#39;s rite):</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><em>&quot;Then a chair is placed for the bishop in Golgotha behind the Cross, which is now standing; the bishop duly takes his seat in the chair, and a table covered with a linen cloth is placed before him; the deacons stand round the table, and a silver-gilt casket is brought in which is the holy wood of the Cross. The casket is opened and (the wood) is taken out, and both the wood of the Cross and the title are placed upon the table. Now, when it has been put upon the table, the bishop, as he sits, holds the extremities of the sacred wood firmly in his hands, while the deacons who stand around guard it. It is guarded thus because the custom is that the people, both faithful and catechumens, come one by one and, bowing down at the table, kiss the sacred wood and pass through. And because, I know not when, some one is said to have bitten off and stolen a portion of the sacred wood, it is thus guarded by the deacons who stand around, lest any one approaching should venture to do so again. And as all the people pass by one by one, all bowing themselves, they touch the Cross and the title, first with their foreheads and then with their eyes; then they kiss the Cross and pass through, but none lays his hand upon it to touch it.&quot;</em></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>It is traditional to read the Passion according to St. John on this day.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "biography": "<p><strong>Painting: </strong><em>The Pieta </em>from&nbsp;Maxo Vanka&#39;s murals&nbsp;in St. Nicholas Croatian Catholic Church, Millvale (suburban Pittsburgh)</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">&ldquo;&lsquo;It is finished&rsquo;; and he bowed his head and handed over his spirit.&rdquo;</span></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?fbclid=IwAR348zInumqMPucf-GMOwkPaOePFQv2JCxb-2mhbKmBn_vS_LJRWtVSGr9I&amp;v=E_iPvOMeUzc&amp;feature=youtu.be\">View Way of the Cross: Meditation in Hymns video</a></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">This most solemn of all days should be marked by fasting, abstinence, and penance, leading us to focus on Jesus upon the cross. The bare, stark appearance of the church serves as a reminder of the solemnity and the sorrow of the day. The Lord of Life was rejected, mocked, scourged, and then put to death on the cross. The faithful need to be mindful of the part which their own sin played in this suffering and agony, as Christ took all sin upon himself, in obedience to his Father&rsquo;s will. By the cross we are redeemed, set free from bondage to sin and death. The cross is a sign of God&rsquo;s never-ending love for us. It is a sign of life, in the midst of death.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Traditionally, the organ is silent from Holy Thursday until the Alleluia at the Easter Vigil, as are all bells or other instruments, the only music during this period being unaccompanied chant.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The service on this day consists of three parts:</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">1) the lessons and solemn collects, including the chanted recitation of the passion by three deacons of different timbres and ranges: Christ, the narrator, and the crowds. The Passion tone, a distinct chant reserved for the passion, is used up until the passage where Jesus dies.&nbsp; Then it is replaced with the intensely sad Planctus (or Weeping) Tone.</span><a href=\"https://chantblog.blogspot.com/2011/04/planctus-tone-aka-holy-week-weeping.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"> </span><span style=\"color:#1155cc\"><u>Audio here</u></span></a></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">2) the veneration of the cross, a devotion showing our love and thankfulness for the gift of life given us by Jesus&rsquo; death, and the singing of the Solemn Reproaches.</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-i1VMXEMPzM\" style=\"text-decoration:none\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"> </span><span style=\"color:#1155cc\"><u>Audio here</u></span></a></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">3) the Eucharist of the Presanctified from the Sacrament consecrated on Maundy Thursday. No Eucharist is celebrated on this day, but Communion (in the species of bread) which had already been consecrated on Holy Thursday is given to the people.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">In all of these, we unite ourselves to our Savior, and we contemplate our own death to sin in the Death of our Lord.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The liturgical observance of this day of Christ&#39;s suffering, crucifixion and death evidently has been in existence from the earliest days of the Church. The pilgrim Egeria described her experience participating in the Veneration of the Cross in Jerusalem in the 300s in this way (not so different from today&#39;s rite):</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><em>&quot;Then a chair is placed for the bishop in Golgotha behind the Cross, which is now standing; the bishop duly takes his seat in the chair, and a table covered with a linen cloth is placed before him; the deacons stand round the table, and a silver-gilt casket is brought in which is the holy wood of the Cross. The casket is opened and (the wood) is taken out, and both the wood of the Cross and the title are placed upon the table. Now, when it has been put upon the table, the bishop, as he sits, holds the extremities of the sacred wood firmly in his hands, while the deacons who stand around guard it. It is guarded thus because the custom is that the people, both faithful and catechumens, come one by one and, bowing down at the table, kiss the sacred wood and pass through. And because, I know not when, some one is said to have bitten off and stolen a portion of the sacred wood, it is thus guarded by the deacons who stand around, lest any one approaching should venture to do so again. And as all the people pass by one by one, all bowing themselves, they touch the Cross and the title, first with their foreheads and then with their eyes; then they kiss the Cross and pass through, but none lays his hand upon it to touch it.&quot;</em></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>It is traditional to read the Passion according to St. John on this day.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Pilate said to them, “Behold the man!”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-6\" id=\"en-ESV-26820\"><sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, “Crucify him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no guilt in him.”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-7\" id=\"en-ESV-26821\"><sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die because he has made himself the Son of God.”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-8\" id=\"en-ESV-26822\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-9\" id=\"en-ESV-26823\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>He entered his headquarters again and said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-10\" id=\"en-ESV-26824\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>So Pilate said to him, “You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-11\" id=\"en-ESV-26825\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Jesus answered him, <span class=\"woj\">“You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above. Therefore he who delivered me over to you has the greater sin.”</span></span></p> <p><span class=\"text John-19-12\" id=\"en-ESV-26826\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>From then on Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, “If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-13\" id=\"en-ESV-26827\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Stone Pavement, and in Aramaic Gabbatha.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-14\" id=\"en-ESV-26828\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover. It was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, “Behold your King!”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-15\" id=\"en-ESV-26829\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>They cried out, “Away with him, away with him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar.”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-16\" id=\"en-ESV-26830\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>So he delivered him over to them to be crucified.</span></p><h3><span class=\"text John-19-16\">The Crucifixion</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-19-16\">So they took Jesus,</span> <span class=\"text John-19-17\" id=\"en-ESV-26831\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-18\" id=\"en-ESV-26832\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-19\" id=\"en-ESV-26833\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-20\" id=\"en-ESV-26834\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-21\" id=\"en-ESV-26835\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but rather, ‘This man said, I am King of the Jews.’”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-22\" id=\"en-ESV-26836\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Pilate answered, “What I have written I have written.”</span></p> <p><span class=\"text John-19-23\" id=\"en-ESV-26837\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom,</span> <span class=\"text John-19-24\" id=\"en-ESV-26838\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>so they said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.” This was to fulfill the Scripture which says,</span></p><div class=\"poetry top-1\"><p class=\"line\"><span class=\"text John-19-24\">“They divided my garments among them,</span><br/><span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text John-19-24\">and for my clothing they cast lots.”</span></span></p></div><p class=\"first-line-none top-1\"><span class=\"text John-19-24\">So the soldiers did these things,</span> <span class=\"text John-19-25\" id=\"en-ESV-26839\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-26\" id=\"en-ESV-26840\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, <span class=\"woj\">“Woman, behold, your son!”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-19-27\" id=\"en-ESV-26841\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Then he said to the disciple, <span class=\"woj\">“Behold, your mother!”</span> And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-19-28\" id=\"en-ESV-26842\">The Death of Jesus</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-19-28\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfill the Scripture), <span class=\"woj\">“I thirst.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-19-29\" id=\"en-ESV-26843\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>A jar full of sour wine stood there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-30\" id=\"en-ESV-26844\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, <span class=\"woj\">“It is finished,”</span> and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-19-31\" id=\"en-ESV-26845\">Jesus' Side Is Pierced</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-19-31\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>Since it was the day of Preparation, and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-32\" id=\"en-ESV-26846\"><sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-33\" id=\"en-ESV-26847\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-34\" id=\"en-ESV-26848\"><sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-35\" id=\"en-ESV-26849\"><sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>He who saw it has borne witness—his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth—that you also may believe.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-36\" id=\"en-ESV-26850\"><sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: “Not one of his bones will be broken.”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-37\" id=\"en-ESV-26851\"><sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>And again another Scripture says, “They will look on him whom they have pierced.”</span></p>  <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div> \n"
