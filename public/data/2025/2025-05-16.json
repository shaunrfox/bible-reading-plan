Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah”—not knowing what he said.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-9-34\" id=\"en-ESV-25327\"><sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>As he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-9-35\" id=\"en-ESV-25328\"><sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, my Chosen One; listen to him!”</span> <span class=\"text Luke-9-36\" id=\"en-ESV-25329\"><sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Luke-9-37\" id=\"en-ESV-25330\">Jesus Heals a Boy with an Unclean Spirit</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Luke-9-37\"><sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-9-38\" id=\"en-ESV-25331\"><sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-9-39\" id=\"en-ESV-25332\"><sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out. It convulses him so that he foams at the mouth, and shatters him, and will hardly leave him.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-9-40\" id=\"en-ESV-25333\"><sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>And I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.”</span> <span class=\"text Luke-9-41\" id=\"en-ESV-25334\"><sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>Jesus answered, <span class=\"woj\">“O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-9-42\" id=\"en-ESV-25335\"><sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>While he was coming, the demon threw him to the ground and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-9-43\" id=\"en-ESV-25336\"><sup class=\"versenum\">43 </sup>And all were astonished at the majesty of God.</span></p><h3><span class=\"text Luke-9-43\">Jesus Again Foretells His Death</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Luke-9-43\">But while they were all marveling at everything he was doing, Jesus said to his disciples,</span> <span class=\"text Luke-9-44\" id=\"en-ESV-25337\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">44 </sup>“Let these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.”</span></span> <span class=\"text Luke-9-45\" id=\"en-ESV-25338\"><sup class=\"versenum\">45 </sup>But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them, so that they might not perceive it. And they were afraid to ask him about this saying.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Luke-9-46\" id=\"en-ESV-25339\">Who Is the Greatest?</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Luke-9-46\"><sup class=\"versenum\">46 </sup>An argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest.</span> <span class=\"text Luke-9-47\" id=\"en-ESV-25340\"><sup class=\"versenum\">47 </sup>But Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a child and put him by his side</span> <span class=\"text Luke-9-48\" id=\"en-ESV-25341\"><sup class=\"versenum\">48 </sup>and said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is least among you all is the one who is great.”</span></span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Luke-9-49\" id=\"en-ESV-25342\">Anyone Not Against Us Is For Us</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Luke-9-49\"><sup class=\"versenum\">49 </sup>John answered, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not follow with us.”</span> <span class=\"text Luke-9-50\" id=\"en-ESV-25343\"><sup class=\"versenum\">50 </sup>But Jesus said to him, <span class=\"woj\">“Do not stop him, for the one who is not against you is for you.”</span></span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",

I built houses and planted vineyards for myself.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-2-5\" id=\"en-ESV-17339\"><sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>I made myself gardens and parks, and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-2-6\" id=\"en-ESV-17340\"><sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>I made myself pools from which to water the forest of growing trees.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-2-7\" id=\"en-ESV-17341\"><sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>I bought male and female slaves, and had slaves who were born in my house. I had also great possessions of herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-2-8\" id=\"en-ESV-17342\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I got singers, both men and women, and many concubines, the delight of the sons of man.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Eccl-2-9\" id=\"en-ESV-17343\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-2-10\" id=\"en-ESV-17344\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart found pleasure in all my toil, and this was my reward for all my toil.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-2-11\" id=\"en-ESV-17345\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, and behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Eccl-2-12\" id=\"en-ESV-17346\">The Vanity of Living Wisely</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Eccl-2-12\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>So I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly. For what can the man do who comes after the king? Only what has already been done.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-2-13\" id=\"en-ESV-17347\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Then I saw that there is more gain in wisdom than in folly, as there is more gain in light than in darkness.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-2-14\" id=\"en-ESV-17348\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>The wise person has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I perceived that the same event happens to all of them.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-2-15\" id=\"en-ESV-17349\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>Then I said in my heart, “What happens to the fool will happen to me also. Why then have I been so very wise?” And I said in my heart that this also is vanity.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-2-16\" id=\"en-ESV-17350\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>For of the wise as of the fool there is no enduring remembrance, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. How the wise dies just like the fool!</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-2-17\" id=\"en-ESV-17351\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>So I hated life, because what is done under the sun was grievous to me, for all is vanity and a striving after wind.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Eccl-2-18\" id=\"en-ESV-17352\">The Vanity of Toil</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Eccl-2-18\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>I hated all my toil in which I toil under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the man who will come after me,</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-2-19\" id=\"en-ESV-17353\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>and who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will be master of all for which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-2-20\" id=\"en-ESV-17354\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>So I turned about and gave my heart up to despair over all the toil of my labors under the sun,</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-2-21\" id=\"en-ESV-17355\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>because sometimes a person who has toiled with wisdom and knowledge and skill must leave everything to be enjoyed by someone who did not toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-2-22\" id=\"en-ESV-17356\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>What has a man from all the toil and striving of heart with which he toils beneath the sun?</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-2-23\" id=\"en-ESV-17357\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>For all his days are full of sorrow, and his work is a vexation. Even in the night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Eccl-2-24\" id=\"en-ESV-17358\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>There is nothing better for a person than that he should eat and drink and find enjoyment in his toil. This also, I saw, is from the hand of God,</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-2-25\" id=\"en-ESV-17359\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>for apart from him who can eat or who can have enjoyment?</span> <span class=\"text Eccl-2-26\" id=\"en-ESV-17360\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>For to the one who pleases him God has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he has given the business of gathering and collecting, only to give to one who pleases God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</span></p>  <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",
