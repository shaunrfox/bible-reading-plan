By no means! Rather, through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-12\" id=\"en-ESV-28206\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Rom-11-13\" id=\"en-ESV-28207\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-14\" id=\"en-ESV-28208\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-15\" id=\"en-ESV-28209\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-16\" id=\"en-ESV-28210\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Rom-11-17\" id=\"en-ESV-28211\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree,</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-18\" id=\"en-ESV-28212\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>do not be arrogant toward the branches.

They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but fear.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-21\" id=\"en-ESV-28215\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-22\" id=\"en-ESV-28216\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-23\" id=\"en-ESV-28217\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-24\" id=\"en-ESV-28218\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Rom-11-25\" id=\"en-ESV-28219\">The Mystery of Israel's Salvation</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Rom-11-25\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>Lest you be wise in your own sight, I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.</span> <span class=\"text Rom-11-26\" id=\"en-ESV-28220\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written,</span></p><div class=\"poetry top-1\"><p class=\"line\"><span class=\"text Rom-11-26\">“The Deliverer will come from Zion,</span><br/><span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Rom-11-26\">he will banish ungodliness from Jacob”;</span></span><br/><span class=\"text Rom-11-27\" id=\"en-ESV-28221\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>“and this will be my covenant with them</span><br/><span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Rom-11-27\">when I take away their sins.”</span></span></p></div> <p class=\"first-line-none top-1\"><span class=\"text Rom-11-28\" id=\"en-ESV-28222\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake.
