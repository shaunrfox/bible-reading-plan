And there are many other traditions that they observe, such as the washing of cups and pots and copper vessels and dining couches.)</span> <span class=\"text Mark-7-5\" id=\"en-ESV-24465\"><sup class=\"versenum\">5 </sup>And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?”</span> <span class=\"text Mark-7-6\" id=\"en-ESV-24466\"><sup class=\"versenum\">6 </sup>And he said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,</span></span></p><div class=\"poetry top-1\"><p class=\"line\"><span class=\"text Mark-7-6\"><span class=\"woj\">“‘This people honors me with their lips,</span></span><br/><span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Mark-7-6\"><span class=\"woj\">but their heart is far from me;</span></span></span><br/><span class=\"text Mark-7-7\" id=\"en-ESV-24467\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">7 </sup>in vain do they worship me,</span></span><br/><span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Mark-7-7\"><span class=\"woj\">teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’</span></span></span></p></div> <p class=\"first-line-none top-1\"><span class=\"text Mark-7-8\" id=\"en-ESV-24468\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">8 </sup>You leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men.”</span></span></p> <p><span class=\"text Mark-7-9\" id=\"en-ESV-24469\"><sup class=\"versenum\">9 </sup>And he said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to establish your tradition!</span></span> <span class=\"text Mark-7-10\" id=\"en-ESV-24470\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’; and, ‘Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.’</span></span> <span class=\"text Mark-7-11\" id=\"en-ESV-24471\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever you would have gained from me is Corban”’ (that is, given to God)—</span></span> <span class=\"text Mark-7-12\" id=\"en-ESV-24472\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother,</span></span> <span class=\"text Mark-7-13\" id=\"en-ESV-24473\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>thus making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down.
