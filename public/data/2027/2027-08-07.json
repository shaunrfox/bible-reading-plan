Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?”</span> <span class=\"text John-9-28\" id=\"en-ESV-26457\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>And they reviled him, saying, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</span> <span class=\"text John-9-29\" id=\"en-ESV-26458\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.”</span> <span class=\"text John-9-30\" id=\"en-ESV-26459\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>The man answered, “Why, this is an amazing thing! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes.</span> <span class=\"text John-9-31\" id=\"en-ESV-26460\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him.</span> <span class=\"text John-9-32\" id=\"en-ESV-26461\"><sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.</span> <span class=\"text John-9-33\" id=\"en-ESV-26462\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”</span> <span class=\"text John-9-34\" id=\"en-ESV-26463\"><sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>They answered him, “You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?” And they cast him out.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text John-9-35\" id=\"en-ESV-26464\"><sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, <span class=\"woj\">“Do you believe in the Son of Man?”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-9-36\" id=\"en-ESV-26465\"><sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>He answered, “And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?”</span> <span class=\"text John-9-37\" id=\"en-ESV-26466\"><sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>Jesus said to him, <span class=\"woj\">“You have seen him, and it is he who is speaking to you.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-9-38\" id=\"en-ESV-26467\"><sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>He said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him.</span> <span class=\"text John-9-39\" id=\"en-ESV-26468\"><sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>Jesus said, <span class=\"woj\">“For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-9-40\" id=\"en-ESV-26469\"><sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>Some of the Pharisees near him heard these things, and said to him, “Are we also blind?”</span> <span class=\"text John-9-41\" id=\"en-ESV-26470\"><sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>Jesus said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, ‘We see,’ your guilt remains.</span></span></p>  <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",
