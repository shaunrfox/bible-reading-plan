Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-11\" id=\"en-ESV-26825\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Jesus answered him, <span class=\"woj\">“You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above.

It read, “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-20\" id=\"en-ESV-26834\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>Many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-21\" id=\"en-ESV-26835\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but rather, ‘This man said, I am King of the Jews.’”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-22\" id=\"en-ESV-26836\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>Pilate answered, “What I have written I have written.”</span></p> <p><span class=\"text John-19-23\" id=\"en-ESV-26837\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom,</span> <span class=\"text John-19-24\" id=\"en-ESV-26838\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>so they said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.” This was to fulfill the Scripture which says,</span></p><div class=\"poetry top-1\"><p class=\"line\"><span class=\"text John-19-24\">“They divided my garments among them,</span><br/><span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text John-19-24\">and for my clothing they cast lots.”</span></span></p></div><p class=\"first-line-none top-1\"><span class=\"text John-19-24\">So the soldiers did these things,</span> <span class=\"text John-19-25\" id=\"en-ESV-26839\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-26\" id=\"en-ESV-26840\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, <span class=\"woj\">“Woman, behold, your son!”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-19-27\" id=\"en-ESV-26841\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>Then he said to the disciple, <span class=\"woj\">“Behold, your mother!”</span> And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-19-28\" id=\"en-ESV-26842\">The Death of Jesus</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-19-28\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfill the Scripture), <span class=\"woj\">“I thirst.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-19-29\" id=\"en-ESV-26843\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>A jar full of sour wine stood there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-30\" id=\"en-ESV-26844\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, <span class=\"woj\">“It is finished,”</span> and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-19-31\" id=\"en-ESV-26845\">Jesus' Side Is Pierced</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-19-31\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>Since it was the day of Preparation, and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-32\" id=\"en-ESV-26846\"><sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-33\" id=\"en-ESV-26847\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-34\" id=\"en-ESV-26848\"><sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-35\" id=\"en-ESV-26849\"><sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>He who saw it has borne witness—his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth—that you also may believe.</span> <span class=\"text John-19-36\" id=\"en-ESV-26850\"><sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: “Not one of his bones will be broken.”</span> <span class=\"text John-19-37\" id=\"en-ESV-26851\"><sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>And again another Scripture says, “They will look on him whom they have pierced.”</span></p>  <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",
