And each creature had two wings covering its body.</span> <span class=\"text Ezek-1-24\" id=\"en-ESV-20489\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>And when they went, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of many waters, like the sound of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army. When they stood still, they let down their wings.</span> <span class=\"text Ezek-1-25\" id=\"en-ESV-20490\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>And there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads. When they stood still, they let down their wings.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Ezek-1-26\" id=\"en-ESV-20491\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>And above the expanse over their heads there was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and seated above the likeness of a throne was a likeness with a human appearance.</span> <span class=\"text Ezek-1-27\" id=\"en-ESV-20492\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>And upward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were gleaming metal, like the appearance of fire enclosed all around. And downward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him.</span> <span class=\"text Ezek-1-28\" id=\"en-ESV-20493\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around.</span></p><p><span class=\"text Ezek-1-28\">Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the <span class=\"small-caps\" style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">Lord</span>.
