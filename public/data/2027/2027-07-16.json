On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me.</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-11\" id=\"en-ESV-28713\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text 1Cor-15-12\" id=\"en-ESV-28714\">The Resurrection of the Dead</span></h3><p><span class=\"text 1Cor-15-12\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-13\" id=\"en-ESV-28715\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-14\" id=\"en-ESV-28716\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain.</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-15\" id=\"en-ESV-28717\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised.</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-16\" id=\"en-ESV-28718\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised.</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-17\" id=\"en-ESV-28719\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins.</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-18\" id=\"en-ESV-28720\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-19\" id=\"en-ESV-28721\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 1Cor-15-20\" id=\"en-ESV-28722\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-21\" id=\"en-ESV-28723\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-22\" id=\"en-ESV-28724\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-23\" id=\"en-ESV-28725\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ.</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-24\" id=\"en-ESV-28726\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power.</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-25\" id=\"en-ESV-28727\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-26\" id=\"en-ESV-28728\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>The last enemy to be destroyed is death.</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-27\" id=\"en-ESV-28729\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>For “God has put all things in subjection under his feet.” But when it says, “all things are put in subjection,” it is plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him.</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-28\" id=\"en-ESV-28730\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him, that God may be all in all.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 1Cor-15-29\" id=\"en-ESV-28731\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>Otherwise, what do people mean by being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized on their behalf?</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-30\" id=\"en-ESV-28732\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>Why are we in danger every hour?</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-31\" id=\"en-ESV-28733\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>I protest, brothers, by my pride in you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die every day!</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-32\" id=\"en-ESV-28734\"><sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>What do I gain if, humanly speaking, I fought with beasts at Ephesus? If the dead are not raised, “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-33\" id=\"en-ESV-28735\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>Do not be deceived: “Bad company ruins good morals.”</span> <span class=\"text 1Cor-15-34\" id=\"en-ESV-28736\"><sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>Wake up from your drunken stupor, as is right, and do not go on sinning. For some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.</span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",
