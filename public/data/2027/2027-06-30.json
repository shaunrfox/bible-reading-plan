Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well and live.”</span> <span class=\"text Mark-5-24\" id=\"en-ESV-24385\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>And he went with him.</span></p><p><span class=\"text Mark-5-24\">And a great crowd followed him and thronged about him.</span> <span class=\"text Mark-5-25\" id=\"en-ESV-24386\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years,</span> <span class=\"text Mark-5-26\" id=\"en-ESV-24387\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse.</span> <span class=\"text Mark-5-27\" id=\"en-ESV-24388\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment.</span> <span class=\"text Mark-5-28\" id=\"en-ESV-24389\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>For she said, “If I touch even his garments, I will be made well.”</span> <span class=\"text Mark-5-29\" id=\"en-ESV-24390\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>And immediately the flow of blood dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease.</span> <span class=\"text Mark-5-30\" id=\"en-ESV-24391\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>And Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out from him, immediately turned about in the crowd and said, <span class=\"woj\">“Who touched my garments?”</span></span> <span class=\"text Mark-5-31\" id=\"en-ESV-24392\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>And his disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, <span class=\"woj\">‘Who touched me?’</span>”</span> <span class=\"text Mark-5-32\" id=\"en-ESV-24393\"><sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>And he looked around to see who had done it.</span> <span class=\"text Mark-5-33\" id=\"en-ESV-24394\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him and told him the whole truth.</span> <span class=\"text Mark-5-34\" id=\"en-ESV-24395\"><sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>And he said to her, <span class=\"woj\">“Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.”</span></span></p> <p><span class=\"text Mark-5-35\" id=\"en-ESV-24396\"><sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler's house some who said, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?”</span> <span class=\"text Mark-5-36\" id=\"en-ESV-24397\"><sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>But overhearing what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, <span class=\"woj\">“Do not fear, only believe.”</span></span> <span class=\"text Mark-5-37\" id=\"en-ESV-24398\"><sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter and James and John the brother of James.</span> <span class=\"text Mark-5-38\" id=\"en-ESV-24399\"><sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>They came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and Jesus saw a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly.</span> <span class=\"text Mark-5-39\" id=\"en-ESV-24400\"><sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>And when he had entered, he said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“Why are you making a commotion and weeping? The child is not dead but sleeping.”</span></span> <span class=\"text Mark-5-40\" id=\"en-ESV-24401\"><sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>And they laughed at him. But he put them all outside and took the child's father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was.</span> <span class=\"text Mark-5-41\" id=\"en-ESV-24402\"><sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>Taking her by the hand he said to her, <span class=\"woj\">“Talitha cumi,”</span> which means, <span class=\"woj\">“Little girl, I say to you, arise.”</span></span> <span class=\"text Mark-5-42\" id=\"en-ESV-24403\"><sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>And immediately the girl got up and began walking (for she was twelve years of age), and they were immediately overcome with amazement.</span> <span class=\"text Mark-5-43\" id=\"en-ESV-24404\"><sup class=\"versenum\">43 </sup>And he strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat.</span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div> \n"
