He associated with him Gorgias, a general and a man of experience in military service. </span> <span class=\"text 2Macc-8-10\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14653\"><sup class=\"versenum\">10 </sup>Nicanor determined to make up for the king the tribute due to the Romans, two thousand talents, by selling the captured Jews into slavery. </span> <span class=\"text 2Macc-8-11\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14654\"><sup class=\"versenum\">11 </sup>So he immediately sent to the towns on the seacoast, inviting them to buy Jewish slaves and promising to hand over ninety slaves for a talent, not expecting the judgment from the Almighty that was about to overtake him.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text 2Macc-8-12\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14655\">Preparation for Battle</span></h3><p><span class=\"text 2Macc-8-12\"><sup class=\"versenum\">12 </sup>Word came to Judas concerning Nicanor’s invasion; and when he told his companions of the arrival of the army, </span> <span class=\"text 2Macc-8-13\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14656\"><sup class=\"versenum\">13 </sup>those who were cowardly and distrustful of God’s justice ran off and got away. </span> <span class=\"text 2Macc-8-14\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14657\"><sup class=\"versenum\">14 </sup>Others sold all their remaining property, and at the same time implored the Lord to rescue those who had been sold by the ungodly Nicanor before he ever met them, </span> <span class=\"text 2Macc-8-15\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14658\"><sup class=\"versenum\">15 </sup>if not for their own sake, then for the sake of the covenants made with their ancestors, and because he had called them by his holy and glorious name. </span> <span class=\"text 2Macc-8-16\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14659\"><sup class=\"versenum\">16 </sup>But Maccabeus gathered his forces together, to the number six thousand, and exhorted them not to be frightened by the enemy and not to fear the great multitude of Gentiles who were wickedly coming against them, but to fight nobly, </span> <span class=\"text 2Macc-8-17\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14660\"><sup class=\"versenum\">17 </sup>keeping before their eyes the lawless outrage that the Gentiles had committed against the holy place, and the torture of the derided city, and besides, the overthrow of their ancestral way of life. </span> <span class=\"text 2Macc-8-18\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14661\"><sup class=\"versenum\">18 </sup>“For they trust to arms and acts of daring,” he said, “but we trust in the Almighty God, who is able with a single nod to strike down those who are coming against us, and even, if necessary, the whole world.”</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 2Macc-8-19\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14662\"><sup class=\"versenum\">19 </sup>Moreover, he told them of the occasions when help came to their ancestors; how, in the time of Sennacherib, when one hundred eighty-five thousand perished, </span> <span class=\"text 2Macc-8-20\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14663\"><sup class=\"versenum\">20 </sup>and the time of the battle against the Galatians that took place in Babylonia, when eight thousand Jews fought along with four thousand Macedonians; yet when the Macedonians were hard pressed, the eight thousand, by the help that came to them from heaven, destroyed one hundred twenty thousand Galatians and took a great amount of booty.</span></p> <h3><span class=\"text 2Macc-8-21\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14664\">Judas Defeats Nicanor</span></h3><p><span class=\"text 2Macc-8-21\"><sup class=\"versenum\">21 </sup>With these words he filled them with courage and made them ready to die for their laws and their country; then he divided his army into four parts. </span> <span class=\"text 2Macc-8-22\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14665\"><sup class=\"versenum\">22 </sup>He appointed his brothers also, Simon and Joseph and Jonathan, each to command a division, putting fifteen hundred men under each. </span> <span class=\"text 2Macc-8-23\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14666\"><sup class=\"versenum\">23 </sup>Besides, he appointed Eleazar to read aloud from the holy book, and gave the watchword, “The help of God”; then, leading the first division himself, he joined battle with Nicanor.</span></p> <p><span class=\"text 2Macc-8-24\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14667\"><sup class=\"versenum\">24 </sup>With the Almighty as their ally, they killed more than nine thousand of the enemy, and wounded and disabled most of Nicanor’s army, and forced them all to flee. </span> <span class=\"text 2Macc-8-25\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14668\"><sup class=\"versenum\">25 </sup>They captured the money of those who had come to buy them as slaves. After pursuing them for some distance, they were obliged to return because the hour was late. </span> <span class=\"text 2Macc-8-26\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14669\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>It was the day before the sabbath, and for that reason they did not continue their pursuit. </span> <span class=\"text 2Macc-8-27\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14670\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>When they had collected the arms of the enemy and stripped them of their spoils, they kept the sabbath, giving great praise and thanks to the Lord, who had preserved them for that day and allotted it to them as the beginning of mercy. </span> <span class=\"text 2Macc-8-28\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14671\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>After the sabbath they gave some of the spoils to those who had been tortured and to the widows and orphans, and distributed the rest among themselves and their children. </span> <span class=\"text 2Macc-8-29\" id=\"en-NRSVCE-14672\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>When they had done this, they made common supplication and implored the merciful Lord to be wholly reconciled with his servants.</span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n</div>\n</div>",
