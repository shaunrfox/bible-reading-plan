        "biography": "<p>Paul, or Saul as he was known until he became a Christian, was a Roman citizen, born at Tarsus, in present-day Turkey. He was brought up as an observant Jew, studying in Jerusalem for a time under Gamaliel, the most famous rabbi of the day. Describing himself, he said, &ldquo;I am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin&rdquo; (Romans 11:1)</p>\n\n<p>A few years after the death of Jesus, Saul came in contact with the new Christian movement, and became one of the most fanatical of those who were determined to stamp out this &ldquo;dangerous heresy.&rdquo; Saul witnessed the stoning of Stephen and approved of it. He was on the way to Damascus to lead in further persecution of the Christians when his dramatic conversion took place.</p>\n\n<p>From that day, Paul devoted his life totally to Christ, and especially to the conversion of Gentiles. The Acts of the Apostles describes the courage and determination with which he planted Christian congregations over a large area of the land bordering the eastern Mediterranean.</p>\n\n<p>His letters, which are the earliest Christian writings, established him as one of the early founders of Christian theology. He writes, &ldquo;I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me; and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me&rdquo; (Galatians 2:20).</p>\n\n<p>Paul describes himself as small and insignificant in appearance: &ldquo;His letters are weighty and strong,&rdquo; it was said of him, &ldquo;but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account&rdquo; (2 Corinthians 10:10). He writes of having a disability or affliction which he had prayed God to remove from him, and quotes the Lord&rsquo;s reply, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.&rdquo; Therefore, Paul went on to say, &ldquo;I will all the more gladly boast of my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me&rdquo; (2 Corinthians 12:9).</p>\n\n<p>Paul is believed to have been martyred at Rome in the year 64 under Nero.</p>\n\n<p>The feast of the Conversion of Saint Paul marks the end of the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity.</p>",
