We have one Father—even God.”</span> <span class=\"text John-8-42\" id=\"en-ESV-26412\"><sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>Jesus said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-43\" id=\"en-ESV-26413\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">43 </sup>Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-44\" id=\"en-ESV-26414\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">44 </sup>You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-45\" id=\"en-ESV-26415\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">45 </sup>But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-46\" id=\"en-ESV-26416\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">46 </sup>Which one of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-47\" id=\"en-ESV-26417\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">47 </sup>Whoever is of God hears the words of God. The reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God.”</span></span></p> <h3><span class=\"text John-8-48\" id=\"en-ESV-26418\">Before Abraham Was, I Am</span></h3><p><span class=\"text John-8-48\"><sup class=\"versenum\">48 </sup>The Jews answered him, “Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?”</span> <span class=\"text John-8-49\" id=\"en-ESV-26419\"><sup class=\"versenum\">49 </sup>Jesus answered, <span class=\"woj\">“I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-50\" id=\"en-ESV-26420\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">50 </sup>Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it, and he is the judge.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-51\" id=\"en-ESV-26421\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">51 </sup>Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-52\" id=\"en-ESV-26422\"><sup class=\"versenum\">52 </sup>The Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon!

And the prophets died! Who do you make yourself out to be?”</span> <span class=\"text John-8-54\" id=\"en-ESV-26424\"><sup class=\"versenum\">54 </sup>Jesus answered, <span class=\"woj\">“If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, ‘He is our God.’</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-55\" id=\"en-ESV-26425\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">55 </sup>But you have not known him. I know him. If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and I keep his word.</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-56\" id=\"en-ESV-26426\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">56 </sup>Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day. He saw it and was glad.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-57\" id=\"en-ESV-26427\"><sup class=\"versenum\">57 </sup>So the Jews said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?”</span> <span class=\"text John-8-58\" id=\"en-ESV-26428\"><sup class=\"versenum\">58 </sup>Jesus said to them, <span class=\"woj\">“Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.”</span></span> <span class=\"text John-8-59\" id=\"en-ESV-26429\"><sup class=\"versenum\">59 </sup>So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.</span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",

        "biography": "<p>When Jesus&rsquo;s disciple Simon confessed, &ldquo;You are the Christ,&rdquo; Jesus responded, &ldquo;You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my Church.&rdquo; This fisherman and his brother Andrew were the first disciples called by Jesus. Peter figures prominently in the Gospels, often stumbling, impetuous, intense, and uncouth.</p>\n\n<p>It was Peter who attempted to walk on the sea, and began to sink; it was Peter who impulsively wished to build three tabernacles on the mountain of the Transfiguration; it was Peter who, just before the crucifixion, three times denied knowing his Lord.</p>\n\n<p>But it was also Peter who, after Pentecost, risked his life to do the Lord&rsquo;s work, speaking boldly of his belief in Jesus. It was also Peter, the Rock, whose strength and courage helped the young Church in its questioning about the mission beyond the Jewish community. Opposed at first to the baptism of Gentiles, he had the humility to admit a change of heart, and to baptize the Roman centurion Cornelius and his household. Even after this, Peter had a continuing struggle with his conservatism, for Paul, writing to the Galatians, rebukes him for giving way to the demands of Jewish Christians to dissociate himself from table-fellowship with Gentiles.</p>\n\n<p>Though the New Testament makes no mention of it, the tradition connecting Peter with Rome is early and virtually certain. According to a legend based on that tradition, Peter fled from Rome during the persecution under Nero. On the Appian Way, he met Christ, and asked him, &ldquo;Domine, quo vadis?&rdquo; (&ldquo;Lord, where are you going?&rdquo;). Jesus answered, &ldquo;I am coming to be crucified again.&rdquo; Peter thereupon retraced his steps, and was shortly thereafter crucified, head downwards. &ldquo;I am not worthy to be crucified as my Lord was,&rdquo; he is supposed to have said.</p>\n\n<p>As we watch Peter struggle with himself, often stumble, love his Lord and deny him, speak rashly and act impetuously, his life reminds us that our Lord did not come to save the godly and strong but to save the weak and the sinful. Simon, an ordinary human being, was&nbsp;transformed by the Holy Spirit into the &ldquo;Rock,&rdquo; and became the leader of the Church.</p>\n\n<p>Since 1908, the eight days between the feast of the Confession of Saint Peter and the feast of the Conversion of Saint Paul have been observed ecumenically as the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity.</p>",
