The service is Morning Prayer (specifically the monastic offices of Matins and Lauds) anticipated the night before (so Wednesday night is actually Morning Prayer for Maundy Thursday).

It is a service sung in the dark with 15 candles on a special candle stand called a hearse. Gradually each candle is extinguished until the church is completely dark and a loud noise is made (&ldquo;strepitus&rdquo;) symbolizing the moment of crucifixion, after which a good amount of silence is kept. The service is Morning Prayer (specifically the monastic offices of Matins and Lauds) anticipated the night before (so Wednesday night is actually Morning Prayer for Maundy Thursday). The text and music includes many psalms as well as the Lamentations of Jeremiah.</span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul8Hx1Fi-e8\" style=\"text-decoration:none\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"> </span><span style=\"color:#1155cc\"><u>Audio here</u></span></a></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>It is traditional to read the Passion according to St. Luke on this day.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
