How then will his kingdom stand?</span></span> <span class=\"text Matt-12-27\" id=\"en-ESV-23517\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.</span></span> <span class=\"text Matt-12-28\" id=\"en-ESV-23518\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</span></span> <span class=\"text Matt-12-29\" id=\"en-ESV-23519\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>Or how can someone enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house.</span></span> <span class=\"text Matt-12-30\" id=\"en-ESV-23520\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.</span></span> <span class=\"text Matt-12-31\" id=\"en-ESV-23521\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.</span></span> <span class=\"text Matt-12-32\" id=\"en-ESV-23522\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">32 </sup>And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.</span></span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Matt-12-33\" id=\"en-ESV-23523\">A Tree Is Known by Its Fruit</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Matt-12-33\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>“Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for the tree is known by its fruit.</span></span> <span class=\"text Matt-12-34\" id=\"en-ESV-23524\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>You brood of vipers! How can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</span></span> <span class=\"text Matt-12-35\" id=\"en-ESV-23525\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil.</span></span> <span class=\"text Matt-12-36\" id=\"en-ESV-23526\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak,</span></span> <span class=\"text Matt-12-37\" id=\"en-ESV-23527\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”</span></span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Matt-12-38\" id=\"en-ESV-23528\">The Sign of Jonah</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Matt-12-38\"><sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.”</span> <span class=\"text Matt-12-39\" id=\"en-ESV-23529\"><sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>But he answered them, <span class=\"woj\">“An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</span></span> <span class=\"text Matt-12-40\" id=\"en-ESV-23530\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</span></span> <span class=\"text Matt-12-41\" id=\"en-ESV-23531\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">41 </sup>The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.</span></span> <span class=\"text Matt-12-42\" id=\"en-ESV-23532\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">42 </sup>The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.</span></span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Matt-12-43\" id=\"en-ESV-23533\">Return of an Unclean Spirit</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Matt-12-43\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">43 </sup>“When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, but finds none.</span></span> <span class=\"text Matt-12-44\" id=\"en-ESV-23534\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">44 </sup>Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ And when it comes, it finds the house empty, swept, and put in order.</span></span> <span class=\"text Matt-12-45\" id=\"en-ESV-23535\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">45 </sup>Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there, and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So also will it be with this evil generation.”</span></span></p> <h3><span class=\"text Matt-12-46\" id=\"en-ESV-23536\">Jesus' Mother and Brothers</span></h3><p><span class=\"text Matt-12-46\"><sup class=\"versenum\">46 </sup>While he was still speaking to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, asking to speak to him.</span> <span class=\"text Matt-12-48\" id=\"en-ESV-23537\"><sup class=\"versenum\">48 </sup>But he replied to the man who told him, <span class=\"woj\">“Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”</span></span> <span class=\"text Matt-12-49\" id=\"en-ESV-23538\"><sup class=\"versenum\">49 </sup>And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, <span class=\"woj\">“Here are my mother and my brothers!</span></span> <span class=\"text Matt-12-50\" id=\"en-ESV-23539\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">50 </sup>For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.”</span></span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",
