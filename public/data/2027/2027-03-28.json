They compelled this man to carry his cross.</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-33\" id=\"en-ESV-24159\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull),</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-34\" id=\"en-ESV-24160\"><sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall, but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-35\" id=\"en-ESV-24161\"><sup class=\"versenum\">35 </sup>And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots.</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-36\" id=\"en-ESV-24162\"><sup class=\"versenum\">36 </sup>Then they sat down and kept watch over him there.</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-37\" id=\"en-ESV-24163\"><sup class=\"versenum\">37 </sup>And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.”</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-38\" id=\"en-ESV-24164\"><sup class=\"versenum\">38 </sup>Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left.</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-39\" id=\"en-ESV-24165\"><sup class=\"versenum\">39 </sup>And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-40\" id=\"en-ESV-24166\"><sup class=\"versenum\">40 </sup>and saying, “You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself!

And the earth shook, and the rocks were split.</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-52\" id=\"en-ESV-24178\"><sup class=\"versenum\">52 </sup>The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-53\" id=\"en-ESV-24179\"><sup class=\"versenum\">53 </sup>and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many.</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-54\" id=\"en-ESV-24180\"><sup class=\"versenum\">54 </sup>When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, “Truly this was the Son of God!”</span></p> <p><span class=\"text Matt-27-55\" id=\"en-ESV-24181\"><sup class=\"versenum\">55 </sup>There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him,</span> <span class=\"text Matt-27-56\" id=\"en-ESV-24182\"><sup class=\"versenum\">56 </sup>among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</span></p> \n <!--end of footnotes-->\n <!--end of crossrefs-->\n</div>\n</div>",

        "biography": "<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Easter Sunday&nbsp;is the greatest of all Sundays, and Eastertide is the most important of all liturgical seasons. Easter is the celebration of the Lord&#39;s resurrection from the dead, culminating in his Ascension to the Father and sending of the Holy Spirit upon the Church. There are 50 days of Easter from the first Sunday to Pentecost. It is characterized, above all, by the joy of glorified life and the victory over death expressed most fully in the great resounding cry of the Christian: Alleluia! All faith flows from faith in the resurrection: &quot;If Christ has not been raised, then empty is our preaching; empty, too, is your faith.&quot; (1 Cor 15:14)</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The octave of Easter comprises the eight days which stretch from the first to the second Sunday. It is a way of prolonging the joy of the initial day. In a sense, every day of the Octave is like a little Sunday.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The word &quot;Easter&quot; comes from Old English, meaning simply the &quot;East.&quot; The sun which rises in the East, bringing light, warmth, and hope, is a symbol for the Christian of the rising Christ, who is the true Light of the world. The Paschal Candle is a central symbol of this divine light, which is Christ. It is kept near the altar throughout Easter Time and lit for all liturgical celebrations.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The Great Vigil of Easter is perhaps the most theologically important service of the Church Year. In it the new fire of God is struck, banishing darkness, and showing forth the victory won on Good Friday; the saving acts of God in history are recounted in the Exsultet and in scripture; new Christians are made through the Sacrament of Holy Baptism; the vows made by all Christians at their baptisms are renewed; and with the end of the Lenten observance, the first Eucharist of the joyful season of Easter is celebrated. The Vigil is not a short service. It marks time in the evening, while the people await the announcement of the Resurrection: &quot;Alleluia. Christ is risen!&quot; He is risen indeed, and the Paschal Candle burns as a sign of the presence of the resurrected Christ.</span></p>\n\n<p><em>For as by a man came death, by a man has come the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive.</em>&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 15:21-22)</p>\n\n<p><em>For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.&nbsp;</em>(Romans 6:5)</p>",
